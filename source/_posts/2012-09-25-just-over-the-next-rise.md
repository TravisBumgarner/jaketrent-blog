When you've climbed up a mountain before, have you ever noticed that there are probably 4 unexpected peaks before the real one?  And especially when you're calves are especially burning?  Sometimes blogging can be like that.

## A Tech blog is born

One platform here, another blog there, and yet another line of thinking written about.  Well, jaketrent.com is yet another -- or is it?  It's my latest (and most glorious!) blog.  It shall be a blog to surpass all [previous blogs](http://rockycode.com/authors/jaketrent) (of mine).

## Mountain without a Peak

It is certainly possible that this isn't the peak.  And that's probably a good thing.  Do you know what happens when you get to the peak?  You climb down and hike another next weekend.

So, what is the mountain I'm climbing?  I breath the world of tech.  I create lots of software.  I'm so intrigued by the fast-paced evolution of things.  There's something new, literally every weekend.  So, instead of a new blog every week, this blog will have something new every week.  It'll be tech, and it'll be sweet.

## Ever-evolving Tech

One of my favorite things about the tech world is its constant evolution.  There is always something new to learn.  There really never is a dull moment.  If you relax, you've fallen behind, and your relevancy begins to diminish.

This blog will push me to be more consistently clear on the state of technology.  It will be a sharing medium for me to teach on what I've learned.  The way software is created in the Internet age is fundamentally different than it was before.  Google is the pair programmer of many.  May it lead you here to find a bit of what you need in your quest.

Tune in.  It's gonna be good.
