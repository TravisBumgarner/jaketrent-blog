This novel is an enlightening look at how our view of the world can have an immediate impact on what that world experience becomes for us.  The "glad game" is one worth playing, in my estimation, for as we learn in the book, there is no situation we encounter where it could have been worse nor is their a situation that won't be made better by finding something to be happy about.
