<div class="entry-content"><p>I started programming on the <a href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic</a> platform in 2010.  It was a very new experience for me.  I don&#8217;t program in it these days, but I still think back on the experiences I had with MarkLogic and in general believe that they made me a better programmer.  Here&#8217;s how.</p>

<h2>First Functional Language</h2>

<p>MarkLogic is a proprietary platform that uses the XQuery language.  This is MarkLogic-flavor XQuery, augmenting the vanilla.  There are first-level functions.  There are sequences.  There are no side effects.  There is no state outside of function scope.</p>

<p>This language proved to require a new way of thinking.  I came from coding Java at the time.  I was without my <code>StringBuilder</code> class.  I remember the first time I tried to build up a string dynamically in code.  There is no such thing as throwing substrings in a builder or a buffer and building it up (no side effects).  Of course, there is a way to build a dynamic string; it is just different.  I became a lot more comfortable with recursive methods for solving problems.</p>

<p>As a side note, the language isn&#8217;t 100% functional.  For instance, there actually are side effects.  For example, the <a href="https://docs.marklogic.com/map"><code>map</code></a> api sets values on preexisting maps and returns the same map.  And the terrible <a href="https://docs.marklogic.com/xdmp:set"><code>xmdp:set</code></a> will bypass all of the functional sauce and set whatever whenever and is to be avoided.</p>

<h2>First NoSql Store</h2>

<p>MarkLogic has its own database built in.  It&#8217;s a document store.  It was the first place I implemented real NoSQL work and pushed it to production.  Here, I learned document design.  I practiced optimizing for reads or writes depending on the use case.  The experience helped me think beyond well-formed tables and embrace the messier data that is more true to life.  I was thinking more in terms of search engines and less in terms of spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Coding in MarkLogic utilizes XQuery which encompasses XPath.  Given that much X technology, the data format was almost assuredly going to be XML.  And so it is.  Every document stored in MarkLogic is XML.  I became a lot better at tree traversal as a result.</p>

<h2>Lack of Libraries</h2>

<p>The MarkLogic ecosystem at the time was really lacking.  I don&#8217;t follow its current state, but it&#8217;s probably safe to say that there is less going on here than in the world of Node or Ruby.  You won&#8217;t find a MarkLogic package manager a la <code>npm</code> or <code>gem</code>.  You probably won&#8217;t even find a library to reuse.  There are literally just a handful of libraries that are shared widely in my experience, and these are lower-level utility libraries of the flavor of UnderscoreJs.</p>

<p>This meant that if I needed code, I was going to write it.  So, I wrote a lot of code.  I learned to produce everything I needed and not rely on any 3rd party code.</p>

<p>This was the same when it came to utilities on the platform.  For instance, there was not a unit test library at the time I started into XQuery.  There was a framework that was written in Java that would exercise XQuery code, but that didn&#8217;t fit my environment needs very well and felt odd, so we wrote our own unit testing framework a la Junit or Jasmine, called <a href="https://github.com/irinc/xqtest">XqTest</a>.  We finally open sourced it (also rare for the MarkLogic ecosystem), but by then several similar frameworks had been created.</p>

<h2>Lack of Help</h2>

<p>MarkLogic is a proprietary system.  There aren&#8217;t many people using it, but those that do license it from the MarkLogic company.  They also pay for support.  Most of the expertise I encountered in MarkLogic was either a visiting consultant from MarkLogic, an engineer I met at the one MarkLogic conference, MarkLogic world, or a fellow in-house engineer.</p>

<p>This means that when you go to StackOverflow, there is a woeful lack of good solutions for common problems.  So, I learned to do a lot of debugging by myself and just keep on keeping on until I figured out the problem.  We had to write almost all of our code, so I was mostly reading my own code, which is easier.  Google wasn&#8217;t a lot of help, and that&#8217;s pretty odd in this age of programming.  Upside was that once I wrote the web article about the subject, I was the first-page <a href="http://rockycode.com/blog/tech/marklogic/">result</a>.</p>

<h2>Playing Ops</h2>

<p>MarkLogic has its own web server as well, built into the monolith MarkLogic server product.  It was a new beast for the ops guys I worked with.  I was as new to it as them, thus I got to play ops a lot more than I would have on our older, more traditional systems.  I got to help keep the thing running.</p>

<p>I also got to help keep the apps tuned.  It turns out that MarkLogic can be either really performant or really <em>not</em> performant.  Often, I wrote the &#8220;not&#8221; way, and I had to help optimize (of course, via our in-house performance monitoring tools).</p>

<h2>The Experience</h2>

<p>I was excited to learn MarkLogic at the time.  It was something new.  I enjoy that.  New code, new team, new thinking.  It was a high-profile product.  It was really a good experience.</p>

<p>I felt like I became very productive on the platform and was able to produce quality and quantity code.  In the end, I chose to not do more more MarkLogic.  I was doing more heavy client-side apps.  The XML just became a stumbling block where Json is king.  The functional paradigm is cool.  I really like it.  But I really don&#8217;t like the XQuery language.  Its api is not very expressive, and its syntax requires a ton of typing.  MarkLogic is growing in its acceptance and use, but not at a huge pace.  It still seems like a niche product, used mostly in the publishing and defense industries.  It didn&#8217;t seem like a great investment to keep spending my golden dev years on the platform.</p>

<p> But for all the pros and cons of the platform and all the ups and downs of the experience, I feel like one of the net effects was that I became a better programmer in new, interesting ways.  For that, I&#8217;m grateful.  I&#8217;m glad I did it, and I&#8217;m glad to move on.  There are, after all, soooo many cool things to try in this age of software development.</p>
