<div class="entry-content"><p>A logo is an essential part of a brand or image.  For me, I like something iconic that is captured through an eye catching image that is simple and elegant.  Logos have to be one of the visual elements that I enjoy watching others&#8217; creativity in the most.  For JakeTrent.com, one of the goals has been to <a href="http://jaketrent.com/post/why-i-chose-a-wordpress-blog/">write on it more and customize it less</a>.  So, far I&#8217;ve met that goal.  But I really couldn&#8217;t let this otherwise nice <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/living-journal">LivingJournal</a> theme sit without adding a bit of pizazz of my own.  So, here&#8217;s how I created the logo.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Hy8OR.jpg" alt="Logo progression" /></p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>I would say that my logo is a confluence of 3 other logos.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="http://trentwalton.com/">Trent Walton</a> logo - It is minimalistic.  Initials for personal sites seems to be all the rage anyway.  It seems to be fitting
2.<a href="http://thenextweb.com/">The Next Web</a>logo - I loved how the type connected.  It&#8217;s very clean.  I almost went with red, but the site here has an accent color of yellow.  So in the end I went with that instead.</li>
<li>Another conference or software logo - I really can&#8217;t remember which it is.  Perhaps you can help me.  It&#8217;s similar to The Next Web logo except that its letters are blue, and they&#8217;re loopier.  And it runs in my mind that it&#8217;s a single word split over multiple lines.  If this is ringing a bell for you, let me know in the comments.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Sketching</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mJPLW.jpg" alt="JT sketch" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m a doodler at heart.  I really like it.  And typography art has been one of my favorites since elementary school.  So, this little project was fun and natural for me once I decided on just doing some initials.</p>

<p>In general, most of my designs are clean, modern, and minimalistic.  (At least those are the <em>good</em> words that come to mind. :)  So I was surprised when I decided I liked this design best.  After I drew it, I made a list of the things it reminded me of.  In order, they were: Tape worm, Christmas candy, measuring tape, bow on a present.  Hehe, what a logo, eh?!</p>

<h2>Illustrator</h2>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have access to a scanner at the time, and my digital camera was out of juice, so I didn&#8217;t make this sketch digital until later.  I just set to work in Illustrator with the pen tool.  I don&#8217;t feel very comfortable in Illustrator.  I feel much more adept at Photoshop.  But, I&#8217;ve been determined to better myself with the Pen tool especially and learn the Illustrator environment.  Given that, I&#8217;m happy with the paths that I drew.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SqUDw.png" alt="JT paths" /></p>

<p>I only had one total restart.  This is version 2.  In planning for the gradients and just wanting to break up the path to make it easier to manage, I split the glyph into 3 separate paths.  I was just eye-balling the sketch, so it&#8217;s not entirely faithful.  Most obvious, the loop on the J has a much more tight, oval loop than in the sketch.  I can&#8217;t decide if I like that more or less.</p>

<h2>Final Polish</h2>

<p>With 3 separate paths, it was much easier to apply some cool-looking gradients to help give the shape some depth.  I chose yellow as the base color and orange as the shadow color.  Again, this was to match the theme.  And it is also reminiscient of a &#8220;dynaLink&#8221; logo that I did once upon a time.</p>

<p>It was a fun project.  I hope it adds a bit to the site and my other online identities (see <a href="https://twitter.com/jaketrent">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/115032056022257436849/">Google Plus</a>).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not perfect, but I wanted to ship it.  What do you like about it the most?  Or what suggestions might you have?  I&#8217;m also interested in which logos have given you the most inspiration in your work.</p>
