    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>React gives us a great component abstraction.  Each of these components represents a node in the DOM.  Each component is self contained, doesn't talk up the component hierarchy directly and passes explicit data and code down the hierarchy.  But what about when you have a React app that wants to reach out and modify something it doesn't control?</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DXuSNbw.png" alt="react modify body tag" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>A Couple Use Cases</h2>

<p>There are potentially a few use cases for this.  For instance, modals that need to render outside your application's potentially <code>position: relative</code> containers.  Or, as we'll see below, your app wants to modify the <code>body</code> tag in your html document.</p>

<p>The most common reason I've found for messing with the body tag is to provide some style attribute.  It's not uncommon to have full-page style differences between pages in our apps.  If you have a "single page" js app in the browser, you need to be able to modify the body tag in code.</p>

<p>Let's use an example where on some pages in your app, the theme is "dark", where the body background color should be black.  On other pages, the entire body background color should be the default white.  We'll make a component that lives high in the hierarchy and takes an <code>isDark</code> property to determine if the rendered page is dark or light.</p>

<h2>Body is Outside Your React App</h2>

<p>You can't mount your React app directly on <code>document.body</code>, at least without warnings.  This is considered bad practice, because other scripts or browser plugins often modify the document body directly.  So you'll have to reach <em>out</em> of your React app and modify the body directly.</p>

<h2>Tie Into the React Lifecycle</h2>

<p>First, you just need a point in time in your app's lifecycle where you know you want to modify the <code>body</code> class.  React has a bunch of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html">lifecycle hooks</a> that will come in handy.  A great early-lifecycle hook for modifying the DOM is <code>componentDidMount</code>.  Usually, we would be accessing DOM nodes that are children of our Component.  Again, in this case, we're reaching out beyond where a React component usually should.  The usual <code>React.findDOMNode</code> functions will not be needed, because React isn't managing the body node.  Instead, we'll just use the <code>document.body</code> api directly.</p>

<h2>Use JavaScript to Modify the Class</h2>

<p>If you have some utility for modifying class names, use it.  If not, it's small and simple enough in <a href="http://jaketrent.com/post/addremove-classes-raw-javascript/">plain old JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p>With these two bits in hand, you have the pieces necessary for your body-modifying component:</p>

<p>```js
import React from 'react'</p>

<p>class BodyColor extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {</p>

<pre><code>isDark: React.PropTypes.bool
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  static defaultProps = {</p>

<pre><code>isDark: false
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  componentDidMount() {</p>

<pre><code>document.body.classList.toggle('darkClass', this.props.isDark)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {</p>

<pre><code>document.body.classList.toggle('darkClass', nextProps.isDark)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  componentWillUnmount() {</p>

<pre><code>document.body.classList.remove('darkClass')
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  render() {</p>

<pre><code>return this.props.children
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>To use, pass an <code>isDark</code> attribute to activate the <code>darkClass</code> class on the body tag:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;BodyColor isDark={true}&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;A Very Dark App&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/BodyColor&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Are there any other ways you've found to reach out of React and modify the DOM directly.  What have been your use cases?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/i-love-css-modules/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-25T11:03:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/i-love-css-modules</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I heard a fantastic yesterday by <a href="https://twitter.com/glenmaddern">Glen Maddern</a> where Interoperable CSS was well-illustrated as the fantastic CSS language advancement that it is.  I was happy to hear hushed ooo's and ahh's from the audience as they realized the power of what they were seeing.  I have been enjoying the benefits of CSS modules myself and my team and would share some of my favorite features in hopes that others will be inclined to use this feature as well.  Cleanse the world of global stylesheets!</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MtjAduk.jpg" alt="i love css modules" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Local Variables</h2>

<p>With CSS modules, your selector names are truly local.  They are FRD local variables!  They won't clash with any var names outside your module.  For You don't have to invent a giant namespace.  There's no BEM-style naming to describe a hierarchy.  There's no repetition in those names.  You can name it something much more simple, just related to what the component is.</p>

<p>For instance, if you're creating <code>Link</code> component, you'd previously have something like <code>.nav__item__link</code> selectors to apply style.  Knowledge of global markup structure would seep into your component through this selector and its name.  Now with a combination of encapsulated components and css modules,  you don't have to worry about the outside world.</p>

<p>Now, what would you call your <code>Link</code> component's outer-most <code>a</code> tag?  Well, maybe <code>.link</code> or <code>.root</code>...  Nothing fancy.  Just what it is.  You aren't required to think about the global stylesheet.  You can focus your mind on just the component stylesheet at hand.  The naming game, which can already be challenging, is made much easier.</p>

<h2>Explicit Dependencies</h2>

<p>Now that all the CSS you write is, by default, local to the module you write it in, you have to explicitly pull in dependencies.  You have to explicitly import the stylesheet you are writing where you'll eventually want to use it.  You can write styles without fear that it might influence something else -- until you explicitly ask it to!</p>

<h2>Still CSS</h2>

<p>I've tried some of the inlining styling techniques and libraries that are being made popular in the React community.  <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium">Radium</a> is my favorite there.  What makes me happy about CSS modules is that they're still CSS.  It's a language that was invented in order to create declarative styles.  It's not wonderful in many ways, but it's still the best tool available for this.</p>

<p>You can use all the selectors, strategies, and css abilities you're used to.  Pseudo selectors are all available.  Media queries work as expected.  Keyframe animations are easy to declare.  There is also a great ecosystem of CSS enhancements and transforms available from the PostCSS community.  No one should ever write a vendor prefix again with <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">autoprefixer</a>.</p>

<h2>Consistency for Components</h2>

<p>Another thing I'd like to see in the web component community, specifically React for now, is a pattern around how to override CSS in reusable components.  This pattern would be well-used by component developers and well-known by component consumers.  This would help components be more immediately useful -- default styles could be included with components and custom styles would be easily applied.</p>

<p>My favorite solution to this so far is <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/react-styleable">react-styleable</a> -- full disclosure, I helped write it.  (Anything like this that gains steam, has broad appeal, and is used by many will make me happy.)  I love that CSS modules enable this and provide a foundation for this consistency.  I'll likely write more about this in the future.</p>

<p>CSS modules have changed the styling game for me.  It makes it so, so much better.  Who knows, maybe it'll change the world.</p>

<p>So, how have CSS modules changed your life?  What do you love?  What could still be better?</p>

<h2>Course on Styling React Components with CSS Modules</h2>

<p>I've published a <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-styling-components">course on Pluralsight on CSS Modules in React</a>.  In the course, you'll learn the supporting toolset.

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/style-file-input/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-23T16:44:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/style-file-input</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>File input fields are notoriously painful to style.  Here are a few quick tips to that will save you some dead ends.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sm1b2ok.jpg" alt="File input" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Problem with File Inputs</h2>

<p>File inputs are inconsistent to start with.  They differ even in their native form across all browsers.  They also have internal elements that are not individually accessible, such as the "Browse" button.  They are also subject to more browser-imposed security constraints than input fields of other types.</p>

<p>Given these inherent problems/constraints, try to follow two basic rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't expect to make your file input look exactly like you'd like</li>
<li>Don't trigger clicks on the file input</li>
</ol>


<h2>Styling the File Input</h2>

<p>Why is file input rule reasonable?  Shouldn't you be able to match the UI design you desire?  Yes, on both counts.</p>

<p>Don't style the file input to make it look like a photo upload button (or whatever you're marking).  Instead, <strong>hide it</strong>.  And after you hide it, position it <strong>over</strong> another another element, such as a <code>div</code>, that you can style much more easily to look like the UI you envision.</p>

<p>Here is some example css on how you might accomplish this:</p>

<p><code>haml fileinput.jade
.file-wrapper
  .file-input(type="file")
</code></p>

<p>```sass fileinput.styl
.file-wrapper
  position: relative
  overflow: hidden
  cursor: pointer</p>

<p>.file-input
  position: absolute
  top: 0
  right: 0
  z-index: 2
  opacity: 0.01
  height: 100%
  font-size: 150px
```</p>

<p>The add additional styles to <code>.file-wrapper</code> to make it look as you wish.  Remember any vendor prefixes you may/not need for <code>opacity</code>, etc.</p>

<h2>Handling Double Clicks in IE</h2>

<p>It's important to position the <code>.file-input</code> as <code>right: 0</code>.  Otherwise, in IE the file input field will not activate on a single click.  Instead it'll need a double click.  This is because in IE clicking on the text box portion of the file input requires a double click.  Clicking on the browse button requires just a single click.  And the browse button is on the right side of the file input field in IE.  Finally, make the <code>font-size</code> big enough that you're guaranteed to cover the <code>.file-wrapper</code> area.</p>

<h2>Handling Clicks</h2>

<p>Now you don't need to have JavaScript to trigger click events on the file input field.  You will just be relying on direct user interaction to click the native file input field.  This will make <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/210643/in-javascript-can-i-make-a-click-event-fire-programmatically-for-a-file-input">some browsers</a>, like Chrome and Firefox, happy.  This is because these browsers won't hold file values given to the input programmatically as a security precaution.  Oddly, IE, which sometimes balks more about innane security constraints like this, is ok.</p>

<p>So, what do you think?  Does this work for you?  Anything else to make the solution more solid?</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[ngStyle Background]]></title>
    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/ngstyle-background/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-19T07:08:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/ngstyle-background</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>ngStyle</code> is the directive used to set inline style attributes with AngularJs.  Most of the time, it's straightforward to use.  <code>background</code> css attributes can be just slightly trickier.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wVBKD.png" alt="AngularJs" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>ngStyle Objects</h2>

<p>The <code>ngStyle</code> directive requires an object for input.  The object key is the css attribute name.  The resultant value for the key is the value of the css attribute.</p>

<p><code>ngStyle</code> is obviously used to set dynamic styles, because static styles are more easily and efficient set using the standard html <code>style</code> attribute.</p>

<h2>A Dynamic Style Example</h2>

<p>So let's setup a controller that sets a dynamic color based on something as useful as the time.  Useful, right?</p>

<p>```coffeescript colorCtrl.coffee
angular.module('colorly').controller 'colorCtrl', ($scope) ->
  $scope.getColor = -></p>

<pre><code>if new Date().getTime() % 2 is 0 then "red" else "blue"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>We could use this <code>getColor</code> function in our app:</p>

<p>```haml app.jade
html(ng-app="colorly")
  head</p>

<pre><code>//- ... include Angular, etc
</code></pre>

<p>  body(ng-controller="colorly")</p>

<pre><code>p(ng-style="{ color: getColor() }")
  | The text will be one of two colors
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>A Background Example</h2>

<p>If we have a dynamic value that needs to go in a css <code>background</code> or <code>background-image</code> attribute, it can be just a bit more tricky to specify.</p>

<p>Let's say we have a <code>getImage()</code> function in our controller.  This function returns a string formatted similar to this: <code>url(icons/pen.png)</code>.  If we do, the <code>ngStyle</code> declaration is specified the exact same way as before:</p>

<p><code>haml
ng-style="{ 'background-image': getImage() }"
</code></p>

<p>Make sure to put quotes around the <code>background-image</code> key name.  Remember, this must be formatted as a valid Javascript object key.</p>

<h2>Another Background Example</h2>

<p>That example was easy.  Often, however, you don't have data stored in your models that's formatted like <code>url(icons/pen.png)</code>.  Instead you often have a field that represents the image path only.  In this case, you must do some JavaScript inside your <code>ngStyle</code> declaration:</p>

<p>```coffeescript colorCtrl.coffee
angular.module('colorly').controller 'colorCtrl', ($scope) ->
  $scope.tool =</p>

<pre><code>name: 'Pen'
icon: 'icons/pen.png'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p><code>haml
ng-style="{ 'background-image': 'url(' + tool.icon + ')' }"
</code></p>

<p>Remember that it's just Javascript, and you'll setup the string concatenation to work just fine.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/css-text-vertical-height/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-03T07:36:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/css-text-vertical-height</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Setting text elements on a page to be a specific height is usually straight forward.  Here are the specs for a couple textual situations you'll encounter.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hxw13Yp.png" alt="CSS height" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Experiments were done in Chrome 27, but this should be pretty consistent over browsers</p>

<h2>Text in a Div</h2>

<p>Text is likely most common just plastered across your site.  Lucky for us all, this is the most straightforward way to calculate and guarantee a vertical height.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cy3HTWW.png" alt="Text height css" /></p>

<p>The formula is simple.  Here, vertical height is calculated by:</p>

<blockquote><p>vertical height = margin + border + padding + (line-height || height)</p></blockquote>

<p><code>line-height</code> or <code>height</code> will determine the height of the main body of the text container, such as a <code>div</code>.  Either one will do.</p>

<p>I will guess that most of the time you'll want your text centered vertically in the container.  But for those times you want it hugging the top or bottom, add a line-height that's either smaller or larger than the height, respectively, to move the text vertically within the container.</p>

<h2>Text in an Input</h2>

<p>Text appearing within an input field is much more tricky and has a quite a few more caveats.  There are two main different modes that vertical height will be determined by: without a <code>height</code> or with a <code>height</code> specified:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4UdHhF4.png" alt="Input height css" /></p>

<h3>No Height Specified</h3>

<p>If the <code>height</code> is not set, traditional attributes, combined, create the total vertical height.  This formula becomes:</p>

<blockquote><p>height = margin + border + padding + (line-height || font-size)</p></blockquote>

<p>Some observations and caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>font-size</code> only affects vertical height as it approaches or exceeds the <code>line-height</code>.</li>
<li><code>padding</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>margin</code> always affect the vertical height, no matter their value.</li>
<li>If <code>font-size</code> is small enough to not affect <code>line-height</code>, <code>line-height</code> can be used for an exact vertical height sum.</li>
<li>If <code>font-size</code>, instead of <code>line-height</code> is affecting the vertical height, the px value of the <code>font-size</code> will not be usable to guarantee height.  Each font has different heights.  A per-font calculation will have to be made.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Height Specified</h3>

<p>If <code>height</code> is set, the input's vertical height formula will always</p>

<blockquote><p>vertical height = height + margin</p></blockquote>

<p>Some observations and caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>If <code>margin</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>padding</code> add up to be greater than <code>height</code>, then that becomes new height.</li>
<li><code>line-height</code> and <code>font-size</code> don't contribute the vertical height, no matter the <code>height</code> attribute.</li>
<li><code>margin</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>padding</code> attributes don't contribute at all to the vertical height if their sum height is less than the actual <code>height</code> attribute.</li>
<li>Once <code>line-height</code> exceeds <code>height</code>, the text in the input moves vertically downward, eventually becoming hidden.</li>
<li>As <code>font-size</code> approaches <code>height</code>, the text will eventually become hidden.</li>
<li><code>border</code> will not affect vertical height, but it will still affect horizontal width.</li>
<li><code>vertical-align</code>, as in most things, does nothing.</li>
</ul>
