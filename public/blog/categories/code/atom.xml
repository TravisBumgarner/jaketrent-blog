    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I heard a fantastic yesterday by <a href="https://twitter.com/glenmaddern">Glen Maddern</a> where Interoperable CSS was well-illustrated as the fantastic CSS language advancement that it is.  I was happy to hear hushed ooo's and ahh's from the audience as they realized the power of what they were seeing.  I have been enjoying the benefits of CSS modules myself and my team and would share some of my favorite features in hopes that others will be inclined to use this feature as well.  Cleanse the world of global stylesheets!</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MtjAduk.jpg" alt="i love css modules" /></p>

<h2>Local Variables</h2>

<p>With CSS modules, your selector names are truly local.  They are FRD local variables!  They won't clash with any var names outside your module.  For You don't have to invent a giant namespace.  There's no BEM-style naming to describe a hierarchy.  There's no repetition in those names.  You can name it something much more simple, just related to what the component is.</p>

<p>For instance, if you're creating <code>Link</code> component, you'd previously have something like <code>.nav__item__link</code> selectors to apply style.  Knowledge of global markup structure would seep into your component through this selector and its name.  Now with a combination of encapsulated components and css modules,  you don't have to worry about the outside world.</p>

<p>Now, what would you call your <code>Link</code> component's outer-most <code>a</code> tag?  Well, maybe <code>.link</code> or <code>.root</code>...  Nothing fancy.  Just what it is.  You aren't required to think about the global stylesheet.  You can focus your mind on just the component stylesheet at hand.  The naming game, which can already be challenging, is made much easier.</p>

<h2>Explicit Dependencies</h2>

<p>Now that all the CSS you write is, by default, local to the module you write it in, you have to explicitly pull in dependencies.  You have to explicitly import the stylesheet you are writing where you'll eventually want to use it.  You can write styles without fear that it might influence something else -- until you explicitly ask it to!</p>

<h2>Still CSS</h2>

<p>I've tried some of the inlining styling techniques and libraries that are being made popular in the React community.  <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium">Radium</a> is my favorite there.  What makes me happy about CSS modules is that they're still CSS.  It's a language that was invented in order to create declarative styles.  It's not wonderful in many ways, but it's still the best tool available for this.</p>

<p>You can use all the selectors, strategies, and css abilities you're used to.  Pseudo selectors are all available.  Media queries work as expected.  Keyframe animations are easy to declare.  There is also a great ecosystem of CSS enhancements and transforms available from the PostCSS community.  No one should ever write a vendor prefix again with <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">autoprefixer</a>.</p>

<h2>Consistency for Components</h2>

<p>Another thing I'd like to see in the web component community, specifically React for now, is a pattern around how to override CSS in reusable components.  This pattern would be well-used by component developers and well-known by component consumers.  This would help components be more immediately useful -- default styles could be included with components and custom styles would be easily applied.</p>

<p>My favorite solution to this so far is <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/react-styleable">react-styleable</a> -- full disclosure, I helped write it.  (Anything like this that gains steam, has broad appeal, and is used by many will make me happy.)  I love that CSS modules enable this and provide a foundation for this consistency.  I'll likely write more about this in the future.</p>

<p>CSS modules have changed the styling game for me.  It makes it so, so much better.  Who knows, maybe it'll change the world.</p>

<p>So, how have CSS modules changed your life?  What do you love?  What could still be better?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/animating-d3-line/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-27T07:01:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/animating-d3-line</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can make some awesome charts in D3.  Animate your charts, and they're made even awesomerer.  To animate lines, such as those found in line charts, try out the following methods.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/94JQ8N8.jpg" alt="d3 line animation" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>D3 Transition</h2>

<p>In order to animate in D3, you call the <code>transition</code> function on a <code>d3.selection</code>.  The transition essentially creates a tween from the starting point of the animation to the specified ending point.  So, to specify an animation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the starting state</li>
<li>Specify that you are transitioning</li>
<li>Set the ending state</li>
</ol>


<p>Then D3 will handle the animation on the diff between the starting and ending state.</p>

<h2>SVG Line Animation</h2>

<p>An SVG line element has 4 required attributes, <code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>, <code>x2</code>, and <code>y2</code>.  These required attributes specify where the line begins and ends in a 2D space.  When choosing your coordinates, remember that the SVG coordinate plane starts at (0,0) in the top-left of the SVG element.</p>

<p>For our line animation, we want the line to look like it's being drawing from the beginning to the ending point.  We will follow the general formula for defining a D3 transition as stated above.  Assuming we have an <code>svg</code> element from the DOM selected, the remaining code might look like this:</p>

<p>```js
svg.append('line')
  .attr({</p>

<pre><code>x1: 25,
y1: 15,
x2: 25,
y2: 15
</code></pre>

<p>  })
  .transition()
  .duration(1500)
  .attr({</p>

<pre><code>x2: 400,
y2: 15
</code></pre>

<p>  })
```</p>

<p>In the code above, the line's starting state shows the line beginning and end at the same point, (25, 15).  This is so that the line appears to be <code>15px</code> long when first seen in the UI.  Then, over time it will grow.  Note that the <code>attr</code>s set after the <code>transition</code> call specify the end of the line as being <code>400px</code> to the right.  Thus, over the duration of the transition (set to 1500ms in order to observe it), the line will appear to grow to its final length of 400px in the horizontal direction.</p>

<p data-height="266" data-theme-id="1749" data-slug-hash="Pqyvqo" data-default-tab="result" data-user="jaketrent" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/jaketrent/pen/Pqyvqo/'>Pqyvqo</a> by Jake Trent (<a href='http://codepen.io/jaketrent'>@jaketrent</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>


<script async src="http://jaketrent.com//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<h2>D3 Line Function</h2>

<p>D3 line functions are specified differently than SVG lines.  An SVG line is guaranteed to be a straight edge from the beginning to the ending point.  On the other hand, a D3 line function can describe a line through many different points, and can thus be anything but straight.  Think of a zig-zaggy line chart, and this is what a D3 line function is meant to accomplish.  Thus, a D3 line function is often used to generate the data needed for an SVG <code>path</code>, not a <code>line</code> element.  There will still be an SVG <code>stroke</code> on a path, but we will use a different technique to animate it.</p>

<h4>Strokes with Dashes</h4>

<p>There are two attributes to of a <code>stroke</code> in SVG that we will use:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>stroke-dasharray</code> - a set of 2 numbers.  The first number is the length of the dash.  The second number is the length between the dashes.</li>
<li><code>stroke-dashoffset</code> - a dash pattern is repeated, according to the <code>stroke-dasharray</code> attribute.  But this attribute specifies where to start in that repeating pattern.  In other words, how many pixels offset <em>into</em> that pattern should the first iteration of the pattern begin.  The default is 0px.</li>
</ul>


<p>To see these numbers change and how they affect a line, check out the following SVG lines:</p>

<p data-height="266" data-theme-id="1749" data-slug-hash="GJYaqK" data-default-tab="result" data-user="jaketrent" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/jaketrent/pen/GJYaqK/'>SVG Stroke Dasharray Grows a Line</a> by Jake Trent (<a href='http://codepen.io/jaketrent'>@jaketrent</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>


<script async src="http://jaketrent.com//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<p>In each of the above cases, the <code>stroke-dasharray</code> is set so the dash line length and the dash space length are equal to the total length of the total line.  Note that the <code>stroke-dashoffset</code> is the only attribute that changes between the 3 lines.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the first, the <code>stroke-dashoffset</code> is set to the length of the total line.  This means that the <code>stroke-dasharray</code> pattern begins at the point where the space between the dashes begins.  Thus, the line appears invisible -- it's just the line-length space between the dashes.</li>
<li>In the second, the <code>stroke-dashoffset</code> is set to the mid-length of the total line.  Thus, the 2nd half of the first dash is visible, making the line seem half as long as its total intended length.</li>
<li>Finally, the <code>stroke-dashoffset</code> is set to 0, meaning that the total line-length dash is now fully visible.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Animating with <code>stroke-dasharray</code></h4>

<p>One could imagine that were the <code>stroke-dashoffset</code> to tween from the full line length to 0, the line would appear to grow from the left to the right.  At first, the space between the dash would be fully visible, slowly, backing off the <code>stroke-dashoffset</code> until the pattern, which begins with a dash be fully visible.  Let's try it:</p>

<p>```js
var data = [
  { x: 15, y: 15 },
  { x: 400, y: 15 }
]</p>

<p>var line = d3.svg.line()
  .x(d => d.x)
  .y(d => d.y)</p>

<p>var path = svg.append('path')
  .datum(data)</p>

<pre><code>.attr({
  'd': line,
  'stroke-dasharray': '385 385',
  'stroke-dashoffset': 385
})
</code></pre>

<p>  .transition()</p>

<pre><code>.duration(1500)
.attr('stroke-dashoffset', 0)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p data-height="266" data-theme-id="1749" data-slug-hash="JdmqRm" data-default-tab="result" data-user="jaketrent" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/jaketrent/pen/JdmqRm/'>JdmqRm</a> by Jake Trent (<a href='http://codepen.io/jaketrent'>@jaketrent</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>


<script async src="http://jaketrent.com//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<p>The above is the simplest possible example of how to make this happen.  In real life, you're going to have:</p>

<ul>
<li>No foreknowledge of the data domain or maybe even the visual space range and will need a d3 scale (eg, <code>d3.scale.linear</code>)</li>
<li>A more complicated set of data which is going to lead to a more complicated line and the actual need for the line function used above</li>
<li>A more complicated line where the length is not immediately obvious and where <code>path.node().getTotalLength()</code> will be useful as a way to use the browser's distance-along-a-path algorithm</li>
</ul>


<p>In the example above, note that the total length of the line is <code>385px</code>.  We make the line dashed.  We set the dash length and the space between the dash length to both be <code>385px</code> using <code>stroke-dasharray</code>.  We define the animation by making the starting state have a <code>stroke-dashoffset</code> of <code>385px</code>, showing nothing but the invisible space between the dash to start.  Then we tween to a <code>stroke-dashoffset</code> of <code>0</code>, causing the offset window to shrink until we see the dash, which is the length of the total line, grow into view.</p>

<p>Frankly, this dash-based solution feels like a hack.  It doesn't seem like someone sat back and thought much about how to animate a non-linear path.  But this solution works well all the times I've used it.</p>

<p>What are some other solutions that you've found for animating lines or creating other interesting line animations?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/using-javascript-function-bind/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-26T07:51:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/using-javascript-function-bind</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JavaScript's Function object has a very helpful method, <code>bind</code>.  It is a great tool to give you control of the ever-squirrely <code>this</code> keyword.  Have you ever had trouble predicting what <code>this</code> will be or making equate to what you want?  <code>bind</code> will help you do that with more power and consistency.  It can also help you with partial function application.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4huM3Xb.jpg" alt="function bind" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The <code>this</code> Keyword</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, what the <code>this</code> keyword refers to changes often.  This can be useful but also unexpected.  Generally <code>this</code>, used within a function, will refer to the context in which that function was called. That calling context might be the global context of <code>window</code> if an event callback is being called in a browser.  That calling context might be an object that contains the function.  For more specific cases, MDN has some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this">great docs on the variety of contexts referred to by <code>this</code></a>.</p>

<h2>Controlling <code>this</code> with <code>bind</code></h2>

<p>When writing code, I often am thinking of <code>this</code> in the context in which I'm writing.  In other words, if I'm writing an object and use the keyword <code>this</code> in a function, I would normally expect <code>this</code> to refer to the object in which I <em>declared</em> the function.  But, again, it is actually the <em>calling</em> context that actually determines the value of <code>this</code>.</p>

<p>To change this default behavior, I can pre-bind the function's value of <code>this</code> to a value of my choosing.  This will happen at the time of <em>declaration</em>, which is what I more naturally would expect.</p>

<p>For example, in <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> we write UI components.  In interesting UIs, we're often handling events like those that occur with user interaction.  Normally events in the browser are attached to the DOM and are executed in the context of the <code>window</code>.  This being the case, it'll be hard for us to create an event handler function in our React Component that can refer back to anything of use in the React Component itself.</p>

<p>As a simple example, we'll write a <code>handleClick</code> function that wants to call the Component's <code>doLog</code> function for interesting logging:</p>

<p>```js event-handling.js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  doLog() {</p>

<pre><code>console.log('Yay, you clicked!')
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  handleClick() {</p>

<pre><code>console.log('this is window?', 
            this == window)
console.log('this is component?',
           this.constructor.name == 'MyComponent')
this.doLog()
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  render() {</p>

<pre><code>return (
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Time to start clicking&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;So, click&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p>

<p>React.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('app'))
```</p>

<p><a href="http://jsbin.com/lixayanoso/edit?js,console,output">jsbin of broken state</a></p>

<p>If you click the button, <code>this.doLog</code> is not available as a function.  How could it be?  <code>doLog</code> is defined in <code>MyComponent</code>, not the <code>window</code>, which is the original context in which the event callback is executed.</p>

<p>To fix this, one need only pre-bind the <code>handleClick</code> function.  By changing one line, we can fix this:</p>

<p><code>js
&lt;button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this)}&gt;So, click&lt;/button&gt;
</code></p>

<p>When this line is executed, it's in the <code>MyComponent#render</code> function, thus the <code>MyComponent</code> context.  So <code>this</code>, at that moment, is <code>MyComponent</code>.</p>

<p>The other detail that makes this work is that <code>bind</code> returns a <em>brand new function</em>.  That's how the pre-binding works.  So, the <code>onClick</code> prop that gets given to the <code>button</code> is a new function where we have said we want to permanently control the value of <code>this</code> to be whatever we bound it to.</p>

<p><a href="http://jsbin.com/luwoxegopu/edit?js,console,output">jsbin of fixed state</a></p>

<h2>Passing Specific Arguments with <code>bind</code></h2>

<p>Another great reason to use <code>bind</code> is to pass specific arguments to a function.  Just as <code>bind</code> can create new functions where the value of <code>this</code> is pre-determined (bound), <code>bind</code> can pre-fill (ie, partially apply) function arguments on the newly-created function.</p>

<p>It may not be immediately intuitive why one would want to create a function with parameters just to turn around and permanently make it so an argument to the function equals a specific value.  It almost feels like hard-coding a wart-ridden value on something that was previously dynamic and beautiful.  Perhaps an example will help.</p>

<p>Again, to the world of React...  As in the previous example, we'll pass an event handler for a click event.  Notice, just as above, that we're passing the function itself (<code>this.handleClick</code> above) instead of the return value of the function (which would look like <code>this.handleClick()</code>).  In this example, we'll have several click handlers, each on a list item, where the button will function as a remove button:</p>

<p>```js
class Item extends React.Component {
  render() {</p>

<pre><code>return (
  &lt;li&gt;
    {this.props.text}
    &lt;button onClick={this.props.onRemove}&gt;Rm&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p>

<p>class List extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {</p>

<pre><code>super(props)
this.state = { items: this.props.initalItems }
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  handleClickRemove(index) {</p>

<pre><code>var clonedItems = this.state.items.slice()
clonedItems.splice(index, 1)
this.setState({ items: clonedItems })
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  render() {</p>

<pre><code>return (
  &lt;ul&gt;
    {this.state.items.map((item, i) =&gt; {
      return &lt;Item text={item} onRemove={this.handleClickRemove.bind(this, i)} key={item} /&gt;
    })}
  &lt;/ul&gt;
)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p>

<p>React.render(<List initalItems={['Do', 'More', 'Reakt']} />, document.getElementById('app'))
```</p>

<p><a href="http://jsbin.com/cinovebasu/edit?js,console,output">A working jsbin</a></p>

<p>In <code>List</code>, we have the event handler, the <code>handleClickRemove</code> function, that takes an <code>index</code> parameter.  In order to make this function work as defined, we are using <code>bind</code> on this line:</p>

<p><code>js
return &lt;Item text={item} onRemove={this.handleClickRemove.bind(this, i)} key={item} /&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This <code>bind</code> call is doing a few things for us:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pre-binding <code>handleClickRemove</code> to the <code>List</code> Component so that <code>this.setState</code> works inside the callback.</li>
<li>Creating a new function that always has <code>i</code> as its first parameter.  Since this line is executed in a loop, <code>i</code> changes.  It will be <code>0</code> for the first item, <code>1</code>, then <code>2</code>.  This is perfect, as we want the first remove button to remove the first item, and so on.</li>
</ol>


<p>Isn't that awesome and useful?</p>

<p>So <code>bind</code> can help make <code>this</code> more predictable for you.  It will help you send new functions with pre-filled parameters.  What else have you used <code>bind</code> for?</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Testing React on jsdom]]></title>
    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/testing-react-with-jsdom/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-18T07:13:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/testing-react-with-jsdom</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>React allows you to create components that will render UI for your application.  If your UI is of any complexity, you'll likely want to test that it functions correctly and allows for future refactors.  There are numerous ways to do this.  One way that you might appreciate is using <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a>, an in-JavaScript implementation of the DOM.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DXuSNbw.png" alt="react on jsdom" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What is jsdom?</h2>

<p>Jsdom is an in-JavaScript implementation of the DOM.  The DOM is the document object model, which is the tree of nodes that make up the UI for documents shown in web browsers.</p>

<p>Because jsdom is implemented in JavaScript, we can have a DOM-like API to work with without needing a browser.  That means that we don't have to capture a browser in order test, a la <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/">Karma</a>.  That means that we can run our tests in environments without browsers, like in Node or in continuous integration environments.</p>

<p>By not using real browsers, we're also essentially saying that we believe the problems in our client JavaScript will not be browser-dependent (again, because we're not capturing <em>real</em> browsers).</p>

<h2>jsdom Requirements</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">latest version of jsdom</a>, as of this writing, requires <a href="https://iojs.org/en/index.html">io.js</a> instead of Node to run.  If you'd like to run in Node.js instead, the <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/tree/3.x">3.x series of jsdom</a> is required.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/06/16/node-js-and-io-js-are-settling-their-differences-merging-back-together/">Node and io.js merge in the future</a>, I expect the new versions of jsdom to support the one, unified platform.</p>

<h2>The Test Runner</h2>

<p>In my JavaScript tests, I prefer to use the <a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> test runner.  It's usable in Node or browser environments.  It has great async test support.  It has the familiar behavior-style syntax of <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> and all the normal test setup hooks that you like.  Most importantly, it features the Nyan cat test reporter:</p>

<p><img src="http://mochajs.org/images/reporter-nyan.png" alt="nyan cat test reporter" /></p>

<p>Mocha lets you choose your own assertion library.  I like <a href="http://shouldjs.github.io/">should.js</a>.</p>

<p>To install both:</p>

<p><code>
npm install mocha should --save-dev
</code></p>

<h2>Configuring Mocha</h2>

<p>By default, Mocha wants a <code>/test</code> directory in your project root in which to put its configuration and potentially your spec files, depending on how you like to organize your projects:</p>

<p><code>
mkdir test
</code></p>

<p>Inside of the <code>/test</code> dir, let's <code>vim mocha.opts</code> and give it a place to configure jsdom and our other libs:</p>

<p><code>text mocha.opts
--require test/utils/dom.js
--require should
--reporter nyan
</code></p>

<p>We have yet to write the <code>test/utils/dom.js</code> file.  We will.  This file includes options for mocha.  Line by line, we're saying that before mocha runs tests, we want to load our <code>dom.js</code> config, the <code>should.js</code> library, and specify our reporter as <code>nyan</code>.</p>

<h2>Configuring jsdom</h2>

<p>I've tried to come up with several configurations that will make jsdom work well with my React projects.  This is the best/simplest that I've come up with.  I'd be interested to hear if you have any suggestions on the approach.</p>

<p>Here's the full configuration with explanatory comments inline, as it would appear in <code>test/utils/dom.js</code>:</p>

<p>```js dom.js
var jsdom = require('jsdom')</p>

<p>// setup the simplest document possible
var doc = jsdom.jsdom('&lt;!doctype html><html><body></body></html>')</p>

<p>// get the window object out of the document
var win = doc.defaultView</p>

<p>// set globals for mocha that make access to document and window feel
// natural in the test environment
global.document = doc
global.window = win</p>

<p>// take all properties of the window object and also attach it to the
// mocha global object
propagateToGlobal(win)</p>

<p>// from mocha-jsdom https://github.com/rstacruz/mocha-jsdom/blob/master/index.js#L80
function propagateToGlobal (window) {
  for (let key in window) {</p>

<pre><code>if (!window.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue
if (key in global) continue

global[key] = window[key]
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>The reason that we want to attach all the <code>window</code> properties to the mocha <code>global</code> object is because developers often write code that is meant for the browser without explicitly using the global environment object.  For instance, in React the developers write:</p>

<p><code>js
navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Chrome') &gt; -1
</code></p>

<p>instead of:</p>

<p><code>js
window.navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Chrome') &gt; -1
</code></p>

<p>Withing taking <code>window.navigator</code> and putting it on <code>global.navigator</code>, you'd get an error like this when running your tests:</p>

<p><code>
ReferenceError: navigator is not defined
</code></p>

<h2>The React Test</h2>

<p>You are now ready to render React components into a document in your tests.  The document will be provided by jsdom.  You don't need a browser environment to run this.</p>

<p>```js mycomponent.spec.js
var React = require('react/addons')
var should = require('should')
var TestUtils = React.addons.TestUtils
var MyComponent = // a React.Component with a <button/> ...
describe('MyComponent', function () {
  it('has button that fires a dom event for click', function (done) {</p>

<pre><code>function handleClick() { done() }
var detachedComp = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(&lt;MyComponent onClick={handleClick}/&gt;)
var button = TestUtils.findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag(detachedComp, 'button')
var buttonNode = React.findDOMNode(button)
should.exist(buttonNode)
TestUtils.Simulate.click(buttonNode)
</code></pre>

<p>  })
})
```</p>

<p>To run mocha with the configuration above, I like to add an npm script in <code>package.json</code>:</p>

<p>```json package.json
{
   "scripts": {</p>

<pre><code> "test": "mocha test/**/*.spec.js"
</code></pre>

<p>   }
}
```</p>

<p>And then type:</p>

<p><code>bash
npm test
</code></p>

<p>Write the source to satisfy your test, and the lights should go green.  Your DOM is happy.  Your test is happy.</p>

<p>Does it work well for you?  How might you improve on it?  Enjoy testing!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Webpack has a jolly little server for your development environment called <a href="http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html"><code>webpack-dev-server</code></a>.  With a touch of configuration, it can be convinced to handle JavaScript history API pushState.</p>

<h2>webpack-dev-server</h2>

<p>Webpack is fast.  But once you have a growing number of static assets to process and a increasily-complex asset pipeline, you may wish for a faster build lifecycle in development mode.  <a href="http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html"><code>webpack-dev-server</code></a> was created for such a purpose.</p>

<p>It is a small <code>express</code> app that handles building your assets according to your webpack configuration, keeping them in memory, and doing so automatically as you change your source files.</p>

<h2>html-webpack-plugin</h2>

<p>In addition to webpack taking care of static assets like css and js for me, in dev mode I'll often include the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin"><code>html-webpack-plugin</code></a>.</p>

<p>This plugin generates an <code>index.html</code> file for you that will keep up to date with the correct references to your assets built inside of <code>webpack-dev-server</code>.  Use of this plugin is perfect in situations where you're building a client-side app that just needs a single html file to bootstrap on top of.</p>

<h2>History API</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries">history API</a> allows the browser to locally handle url changes that would usually signal a need to go back to the server for resources.  This allows client-side apps to include routers that can navigate from urls like <code>http://localhost:3000/one-place</code> to <code>http://localhost:3000/another</code> instead of having to use the url hash (eg, <code>http://localhost:3000#/one-place</code>).</p>

<h2>All routes to <code>index.html</code></h2>

<p>By default, <code>webpack-dev-server</code> is setup to serve assets directly from the http requests received.  For instance, if my <code>webpack-dev-server</code> was running on port <code>3000</code>, and my <code>webpack.config.js</code> was setup so that I was building a <code>main.js</code> for my application, I could make a request to get that build asset via <code>http://localhost:3000/main.js</code>.</p>

<p>Likewise, if I'm using the <code>html-webpack-plugin</code>, I can make a request to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> to get my <code>index.html</code> file, which contains the <code>script</code> tag to bootstrap my app -- again, likely something like <code>main.js</code>.</p>

<p>But if my app has a client-side router that is using the history API, how do I get <code>webpack-dev-server</code> to differentiate a client-side route from an asset request to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>?</p>

<h2><code>historyApiFallback</code> Option</h2>

<p>It turns out that we're in luck.  <code>webpack-dev-server</code> includes a useful option named <code>historyApiFallback</code>.  If this boolean flag is set to true, all requests to the <code>webpack-dev-server</code> that do not map to an existing asset will instead by routed straight to <code>/</code>, that is, the <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

<p>This is exactly what we want.  If we want more customization in the fallback routes, we can specify that as well.  Internally, <code>webpack-dev-server</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/bripkens/connect-history-api-fallback"><code>connect-history-api-fallback</code></a> which takes several options.</p>

<p>These options include overriding the name of the index file or rerouting certain request url patterns to different html files in the case you have multiples.  These options can be set by passing an object to <code>historyApiFallback</code> instead of a boolean flag.</p>

<p>Finally, in order to not have to type this every time you want to run the <code>webpack-dev-server</code> cli, you can specify all of these options in the <code>webpack-config.js</code> under the <code>devServer</code> attribute.</p>

<p>The simple example looks like:</p>

<p>```js webpack-config.js
{
  //...
  devServer: {</p>

<pre><code>port: 3000,
historyApiFallback: true
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>A more complex example might look something like:</p>

<p>```js webpack-config.js
{
  //...
  devServer: {</p>

<pre><code>port: 3000,
historyApiFallback: {
  index: 'default.html',
  rewrites: [
    { from: /\/soccer/, to: '/soccer.html'}
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>Given the above configuration, routes like <code>/one-place</code> and <code>/another</code> would go to <code>/</code>, which is backed by the <code>default.html</code> markup.  Routes like <code>/soccer/schedule</code> or <code>/soccer/games/123</code> would go to <code>soccer.html</code>.</p>

<p>So, you don't need to write your own proxy.  The option is built in for you.  webpack excites again!</p>

<p>What other things have you been surprised that webpack already does for you?</p>
