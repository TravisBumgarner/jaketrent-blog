    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Node.js is everywhere.  There's a lot of room foro people to learn and get into it.  A good starter book is <a href="http://amzn.to/14ttetp">Smashing Node by Guillermo Rauch</a>.  Here's what I thought and what I learned while reading it.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hQTBeAF.jpg" alt="Smashing Node" /></p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Overall, I would call Smashing Node an introduction to Node book.  This is a good thing.  It does a nice job of building on itself.  It starts with the JavaScript that everyone knows and advances to the new places that Node allows you to go.  The chapters are incremental.</p>

<p>It's a good length.  This is not a tome that you might pick up in a level 3 dungeon in order to boost your fire magic.  You can read a couple chapters a day and be done in a week.  Thankfully, it's in consumable-sized bits.  Maybe you'll end up boosting your fire magic a bit too.</p>

<p>The book boasts a fair breadth of subjects.  It introduces purely syntax subjects.  It also expands into working examples dealing with real network protocols and database apis.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>

<p>Guirremo has a very easy-to-read, conversational style.  I value this more and more in books -- perhaps even especially in technical books.  It helps me engage.  It helps me read faster and more.  I can read API docs when I need them.  A book should not read like an API doc.</p>

<p>Most subjects in the book were chosen well.  I enjoyed almost all of them.  There always is a bottom of the list, however, and mine ended with the MySQL, HTTP, and TCP chapters.  Knowledge on those subjects is probably good to have, but I had to slog through these chapters.</p>

<p>The code examples were enjoyable because they eventually turned into functional prototypes.  We built a Twitter client, an IRC chat, a social DJ program, and more.  That's pretty cool.  The downside was that the code examples could get a little long.  And with the entire working example, complete with all the npm commands and boilerplate code, sometimes the meaningful bits got a little obscured.  I read the book as a <a href="http://amzn.to/14ttetp">Kindle book</a> on a phone, so the long code snippets probably seemed even longer than they were.</p>

<h2>Highlight Subjects</h2>

<h4>Express Features</h4>

<p>I use <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> more than any other library in Node.  It's a great HTTP request/response wrapper that makes creating web servers fun and easy.  Even so, this book introduced a number of features of the library that I was previously unaware of.  Generally, I think it helped illuminate for me a lot of the bits of Connect, which functions underneath Express.  Specifically, did you know that you can modify the Express logger to log specific request tokens of your choosing?</p>

<h4>Redis</h4>

<p>There was a great section that took a look at <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">Mongo</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, and <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>.  I enjoyed the chapter on Redis the most.  This is probaby somewhat because I have the most to learn in Redis and have used it the least.  I was also impressed at the ease with which Guirremo layed out a simple social graph using the Redis API.  The chosen tools, Node and Redis, made it simple, short, and elegant.</p>

<p>Try writing many of the code examples in this book in Java and printing them on dead trees.  You'll need a bigger backpack.</p>

<h4>Testing</h4>

<p>I enjoyed the fact that testing was even mentioned.  A few testing styles and frameworks were introduced.  It was enjoyable but very light.  It would be cool to see a more thorough treatment, perhaps with applicable tests worked into the examples throughout the book.</p>

<p>In this same vein, I think the book did an ok job at addressing the subject of error handling.  I think this book and other Node resources and educators should focus more on this issue.  It is, after all, more important in Node's single-threaded environment than on most platforms.</p>

<h4>Web Sockets</h4>

<p>I had only previously done web sockets via <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a>, a web socket wrapper written by the author of the book.  It was good to see vanilla web sockets in action so I could better understand the technology, its limitations, and be grateful for the great libraries that help it be more useful and easy to use.</p>

<h4>Great Libraries</h4>

<p>The booked worked in usages of some great libraries throughout the coding examples.  As mentioned, <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a> is a great web socket wrapper.  <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent">Superagent</a> is a great higher-level request API.  <a href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a> is a fantastic test framework.  And <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> provides a nice model layer on top of the native MongoDb calls.</p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for?  Go learn Node!  Use this book to help you.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/how-to-make-pinterest-webservice/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-18T07:06:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/how-to-make-pinterest-webservice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pinterest currently does not have an official webservice API.  It seems kind of crazy in this day and age.  They really should have one.  I can't think what the business reasons might be for not having one.</p>

<p>They've not had one for long enough that it's high time we write our own.  It'll be surprisingly easy with a few choice tools</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7cv9d.png" alt="Pinterest API" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Webservice API on NodeJs</h2>

<p><a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJs</a> is just a fun platform to write IO-heavy applications for the web.  We're going to write a quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> endpoint using the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> library that allows us to consume real Pinterest content that's not available via a pre-existing service.</p>

<h4>Screen Scrape Pinterest</h4>

<p>Given no API, we're left to our own devices.  The data for Pinterest is only exposed via the UI on the website.  We're going to have our service visit that UI and grab the data that we need as a user of a web browser would see it.  This is screen scraping.  There a lot of downsides here, but we wouldn't be trying it if there was an API already.</p>

<p>One down side is that our service will be brittle.  If Pinterest ever changes the layout of the page, our service won't be able to bring back the right data.  Our solution will be simple, so it'll be easy to update, but this should be a red flag not to do anything mission critical via screen scraping unless you're giving it your full attention.</p>

<p>Another down side might be speed.  Screen scraping a UI is not the fastest way to get data.  We'll try and help mitigate this with the fastest tools that we have.  NodeJs is a blasted fast web server.  A library called <a href="https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio">cheerio</a> is supposedly best-in-class for screen scraping (advertised as 8x faster than <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a>).</p>

<h4>Caching</h4>

<p>To make this retrieval even faster for repeat use, caching could be very helpful.  We could cache in our service what we get back from pinterest via some datastore or we could cache in our client.  Best practices here will be very dependent on your use case.  These kind of enhancements have been made over and over again and would only clutter the simple Pinterest interaction, so I will exclude them for now.</p>

<h2>Getting Pinterest Data</h2>

<p>Here's the final solution in all its glory.  This snippet only includes only the code inside the Express route.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/npm-install-local-files/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-14T08:23:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/npm-install-local-files</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you'll want to use <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a> to install a package that doesn't exist in the official npm registry for some reason.  Maybe you're developing the package yourself.  Maybe it's an internal use-only package. Maybe the package writer never published it.  Here are a few ways to install a local package with npm.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xnDMm.jpg" alt="Node Package Manager" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Link the Local Node Package</h2>

<p>If you're developing a package locally, you're likely making lots of changes to the source.  You don't want to publish after each change in order to install this package as a dependency elsewhere.  Npm has provided the <a href="http://npmjs.org/doc/link.html">link</a> keyword.</p>

<p>This allows your put a global label on your package that tells your local npm cache about it:</p>

<p><code>bash
cd &lt;pkg_dir&gt;;
npm link;
</code></p>

<p>And then go to the local project that you're using the package in and point to the dependency by package name:</p>

<p><code>bash
cd &lt;project_dir&gt;;
npm link &lt;pkg_name&gt;;
</code></p>

<p>Now you have symlinked a directory called <code>&lt;pkg_name&gt;</code> in the project's node_modules directory.  Changes you make in your package will appear and be usable from within your project.</p>

<h2>Tarball the Local Node Package</h2>

<p>Npm can <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/install.html">install</a> either a path or url to a local tarball.  To create a tarball that npm will like, you want to run npm <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/pack.html">pack</a>:</p>

<p><code>bash
cd &lt;pkg_dir&gt;;
npm pack
</code>
This will create a tarball a la <code>&lt;pkg_name&gt;-&lt;pkg_ver&gt;.tgz</code>.  Now just store your new tarball somewhere like a local filesystem or server that is accessible when you run npm install on your dependant project.</p>

<p>You can ask for the tarball manually:</p>

<p><code>bash
npm install http://localServer/my-pkg-0.0.1.tgz
</code></p>

<p>Or put the reference in your package.json for later:</p>

<p>```js
{
  "dependencies": {</p>

<pre><code>"my-pkg": "http://localServer/my-pkg-0.0.1.tgz"
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>You probably have a node package that's only available locally for a reason.  To guarantee that it's not accidentally published to the world via the npm registry, add this beaut to your package.json:</p>

<p><code>js
{
   "private": true
}
</code></p>

<h2>Replicate the Npm Registry</h2>

<p>If you're going all out, like creating a corporate npm registry, you always have the option of <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/registry.html#Can-I-run-my-own-private-registry">replicating</a> the Npm registry internally.  It's CouchDb, and '<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120029/quotes?qt=qt0192627">replication</a>' is its Chinese neighbor's middle name.  You can publish your own packages there so they're still private to your and your organization.  And you also get local references to the public packages.</p>

<h2>The Glory of Npm</h2>

<p>Npm is great.  The ability to install published or local packages is an example of its flexibility and usefulness.  What are the other ways that you've found to make non-public packages installable -- for instance, that package that the writer just never bothered to publish to npm?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/environment-variables-in-node/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-05T16:12:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/environment-variables-in-node</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes things change in different environments.  For one, I wear a tie to church but try not to otherwise.  In Node, you might want variables to change per environment.  And it turns out people have wanted this exact thing, creating marvels of code for us to use as we please.  Enter, nconf.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5rZ8H.png" alt="Environment variables in Node" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Nconf</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flatiron/nconf">Nconf</a> provides "hierarchical node.js configuration with files, environment variables, command-line arguments, and atomic object merging."  It is a great little package provided by the folks at <a href="http://nodejitsu.com/">NodeJitsu</a>.</p>

<p>To install, run a little:</p>

<p><code>
$ npm install nconf
</code></p>

<h4>Environment Variables in Node</h4>

<p>Often, NodeJs environments are specified through the aptly-named environment variables.  These are the variables that are set on a system level, available to yours and other applications.  In Unixy environments, you'd set one with:</p>

<p><code>
$ export NODE_ENV=production
</code></p>

<p>And it turns out that <code>NODE_ENV</code> is the single most-used environment variable of them all.  Really, it's the big kahuna that triggers other environment variables or code for activation.</p>

<p>For instance, in an <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> app, you'll see this a lot:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Actually, you see <a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.configure"><code>configure()</code></a>, but it's all just sugar around a check to <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code>.</p>

<h4>Set NODE_ENV and Start Node</h4>

<p>If you want to start node and set the environment variable all in a one liner, try:</p>

<p><code>
$ export NODE_ENV=production &amp;&amp; node app.js
</code></p>

<h4>Multiple, Variable Sources</h4>

<p>You could just grab all your variables out the process environment, but the cool thing that nconf gives you is a hierarchy.  The <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/nconf">docs</a> give the probable example of the following hierarchy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Command-line arguments</li>
<li>Environment variables</li>
<li>A file</li>
</ol>


<p>One could access these sources in code with this beaut:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">nconf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;nconf&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">nconf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">argv</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">code</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">file</span><span class="o">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="s1">&#39;config.json&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>You could even have a config file specific to each environment that ships with your app and load it with a slightly spiffier:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">nconf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;nconf&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">nconf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">argv</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">code</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">file</span><span class="o">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="nx">process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">NODE_ENV</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;.json&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<h4>Using the Data</h4>

<p>Finally, after loading, just access your environment variables and incorporate them in your code as you will:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">nconf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;NODE_ENV&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Declare some variables per environment.  Likely candidates are database connection strings or web service endpoints or feature flags.  These will help you avoid as many nasty if-else branches in your code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you every wished you could change your node script and not restart the server?  Restarting your node server after changing your script can get annoying.  This is especially true if you're in guess and check mode, changing and checking a lot.  Luckily, there are a few tools to save you the pain.</p>

<h2>Node-supervisor</h2>

<p>Isaac Schlueter has created a <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor">node-supervisor</a>.  Install it with a quick npm:</p>

<pre><code>sudo npm install supervisor -g
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>supervisor</code>, instead of <code>node</code> to start your app:</p>

<pre><code>supervisor app.js
</code></pre>

<p>By default, this will run with these options:</p>

<pre><code>DEBUG: Running node-supervisor with
DEBUG:   program 'app.js'
DEBUG:   --watch '.'
DEBUG:   --ignore 'undefined'
DEBUG:   --extensions 'node|js'
DEBUG:   --exec 'node'
</code></pre>

<p>There are other options for things like watching only specific extensions or not restarting on app errors.</p>

<h2>Nodemon</h2>

<p>Remy Sharp has created <a href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon">nodemon</a>.  It also is a quick npm install:</p>

<pre><code>sudo npm install nodemon -g
</code></pre>

<p>Again, run with <code>nodemon</code> instead of <code>node</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nodemon app.js
</code></pre>

<p>By default, runs:</p>

<pre><code>[nodemon] v0.6.23
[nodemon] watching: .
[nodemon] starting `node app.js`
</code></pre>

<p>There are similar options here for what to watch.</p>

<h2>Comparison of tools</h2>

<p>Both tools will get the job done.  Choose either.  Both can specific directories or file extensions to watch.  Both can run other executables (like <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever">forever</a>, which is awesome, btw).</p>

<p>Both tools are circa 2010.  Node-supervisor is the slightly older brother (by 8 months).  Both projects seem to have slow, steady development development activity.  What is there to add to tools that do their job already?</p>

<p>In general, <code>nodemon</code> has a few more options.  For example, it has explicit support for coffee-script.  I like <code>supervisor</code> more for silly reasons:  I found it first, it works fine, feels better to type, and has fewer terminal command expansion conflicts.</p>
