    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes a <code>table</code> element is the most semantic element one can use in markup.  It is true.  If you're displaying tabular data, a <code>table</code> is a likely option.  If you're on a responsive site, however, you'll cringe at this option.  It turns out that tables aren't very responsive web design-friendly.  One way to create a more responsive table is with scrolling.</p>

<h2>Responsive Table Options</h2>

<p>I love the article by Chris Coyier that describes <a href="http://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/">responsive tables</a>.  Some of his ideas and those of the commenters on his post a great at thinking outside the box on what the options include for responsive tables:</p>

<ol>
<li>Orient the table vertically when there's not enough room for all the columns.</li>
<li>Replace tabular data with a graphic, such as a pie graph, that communicates the same gist.</li>
<li>Replace the table with a link that opens a scrollable view large enough for the regular-sized table.</li>
</ol>


<p>My favorite option is the first.  But, in my case, it didn't seem to work extremely well because I have two headers.  The example had column headers only.  I have row headers as well.  After a bit more looking, I ran across this <a href="http://www.zurb.com/playground/playground/responsive-tables/">Zurb scrolling table css and js example</a>.  The best solution, it seemed for now, was scrolling.  (My example code is based on the markup and styles of the Zurb code with a few things taken out and a few things added.)</p>

<h2>Table Horizontal Scrolling</h2>

<p>On the web, vertical scrolling is a part of the full meal deal.  So, the only thing to solve is the horizontal scrolling.  Normally, we don't want content flowing off the right side of the screen when browsing.  So, we when there's scrolling required, we're going to do it within the table only and for the columns we want.</p>

<h4>Divide table in two</h4>

<p>We want some columns to scroll and others to remain pinned whilst scrolling.  We'll duplicate the table in the markup and wrap each, a la:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;table-wrapper&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;pinned&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c">&lt;!-- table here with pinned columns only--&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;scrollable&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c">&lt;!-- table here with scrollable columns only--&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<h4>Line up the rows</h4>

<p>Now we have two tables.  The flexibility we've given ourself is that we can make some columns stick and others scroll easily.  Our new challenge is keeping the row height lined up so the two tables look like one.</p>

<p>Put the two tables next to each other with a float left and a float right.  Make the widths percentage-based as with any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">rwd</a>.</p>

<p>Now we have a few options to make our rows line up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Explicitly set all table cells to the same height</li>
<li>Use JavaScript to make each cell in a row be the same height as the tallest cell in that row</li>
<li>Put similar content in each cell on a row (eg, just text with the same attributes that will not wrap for longer text)</li>
</ol>


<p>Turns out that I will choose option 1 for the table cells (<code>td</code>) and option 3 for the table headers (<code>th</code>).</p>

<p>This is my least favorite feature of this solution.  Anyone have a better idea on lining up the rows?</p>

<h4>Set column width</h4>

<p>I want some of my columns to have a set width.  Well, as <em>set</em> as anything is in rwd.  An html <code>table</code> will usually expand and contract columns across the table to give optimum spacing based on the content.</p>

<p>I want to make my pinned table columns allow extra-long content, but I don't want their widths to change at all.  A bit of StackOverflow love yielded this answer on why <code>overflow: hidden</code> doesn't work when <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/7570613/118561">constraining table cell width</a>.</p>

<p>In short, the solution is to wrap the content inside of the <code>td</code> with two <code>divs</code>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;outer&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;inner&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    Row 4 longer than lotr
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And sprinkle with a bit of stylesheet:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">td</span> <span class="nc">.outer</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">position</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">relative</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">height</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">30px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">td</span> <span class="nc">.inner</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">overflow</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">hidden</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">white-space</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">nowrap</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">position</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">absolute</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">100</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This style will let the column width remain and the content overflow.  It will also keep the cell text on one line, and it will be hidden as it flows off the right-hand side of the cell.  To wrap and hide as it flows off the bottom of the cell, remove the <code>white-space: nowrap</code> attribute.</p>

<h2>Responsive Table with Scrolling</h2>

<p>For the final result, check out the <a href="http://codepen.io/jaketrent/pen/CcboI">CodePen for the responsive table</a> below:</p>

<p><pre class="codepen" data-height="400" data-type="result" data-href="CcboI" data-user="jaketrent"><code></code></pre>
<script async src="http://codepen.io:/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Agile method of software creation contains many principles of development that will help create good software.  Some of my most successful projects have had as a key feature an agile designer.  As Jobs said, design <em>is</em> how it works, and that means that to really deliver well in an agile environment, design <em>and</em> development have to be on the agile train together.</p>

<h2>K-man Keeps it Alive</h2>

<p>I work with a fantastic designer, the one and only <a href="http://www.composition3.com/">Kendall Chadwick</a>.  He has many great qualities of an agile designer:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>He's available</strong> - He lives with the cross-functional team.  He is there to participate in discussions.  It's not hard to get a hold of him, so answers to questions flow more freely.</li>
<li><strong>He listens</strong> - He asks a lot of questions.  He's not stuffy about his design sense.  He realizes that many needs are represented in a project and product.  He attends discussion meetings not necessarily focused on design but on the details of the product or process.</li>
<li><strong>He's fully engaged</strong> - He knows his task doesn't end when he clicks save in Photoshop.  He owns his designs and ideas all the way through the project, helping evolve them as we go. One of the most important things a software team member can do is remain fully engaged right up until the product ships.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Agile Experience Design</h2>

<p>I just finished a book called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Experience-Design-Designers-Continuous/dp/0321804813">Agile Experience Design</a>" by Lindsay Ratcliffe and Marc McNeill.  I've read a fair bit on agile methods and currently live in a quasi-agile (hehe, let's actually call it mini-waterfalls) shop.  This book was intriguing as its authors are speaking to designers as they try to integrate better in an agile environment.</p>

<p>Of note was their Agile Design Manifesto:</p>

<p>Agile experience design is
Inclusive rather than elitist
Emergent with direction rather than up front
Integrated and collborative rather than handed over the fence
Considerate of customer, business, and technology needs rather than biased toward a single factor.</p>

<p>As a passing review:  The book won't provide too much that is new to someone familiar with agile.  It speaks in terms that I suppose are probably more well related to by designers.  It's a somewhat lengthy and dense book.  At times, it was hard to maintain reading momentum.  The book is beautiful -- perhaps it had some real designers laying it out?</p>

<h2>The Power of Design</h2>

<p>It's amazing how much depends on solid design.  The design will define the users' experience with the software.  It will never not matter.  To a great design in a software product is a difficult thing.  Good people in the design discipline who are fully engaged in adapting to the changing landscape of software creation are invaluable.  Agile designers rock.  Find one and figure out how to get him on your project.</p>

<p>What have your best designers done to make great software on your teams?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/the-jaketrent-dot-com-logo/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-15T16:59:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/the-jaketrent-dot-com-logo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A logo is an essential part of a brand or image.  For me, I like something iconic that is captured through an eye catching image that is simple and elegant.  Logos have to be one of the visual elements that I enjoy watching others' creativity in the most.  For JakeTrent.com, one of the goals has been to <a href="http://jaketrent.com/post/why-i-chose-a-wordpress-blog/">write on it more and customize it less</a>.  So, far I've met that goal.  But I really couldn't let this otherwise nice <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/living-journal">LivingJournal</a> theme sit without adding a bit of pizazz of my own.  So, here's how I created the logo.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Hy8OR.jpg" alt="Logo progression" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>I would say that my logo is a confluence of 3 other logos.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="http://trentwalton.com/">Trent Walton</a> logo - It is minimalistic.  Initials for personal sites seems to be all the rage anyway.  It seems to be fitting
2.<a href="http://thenextweb.com/">The Next Web</a>logo - I loved how the type connected.  It's very clean.  I almost went with red, but the site here has an accent color of yellow.  So in the end I went with that instead.</li>
<li>Another conference or software logo - I really can't remember which it is.  Perhaps you can help me.  It's similar to The Next Web logo except that its letters are blue, and they're loopier.  And it runs in my mind that it's a single word split over multiple lines.  If this is ringing a bell for you, let me know in the comments.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Sketching</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mJPLW.jpg" alt="JT sketch" /></p>

<p>I'm a doodler at heart.  I really like it.  And typography art has been one of my favorites since elementary school.  So, this little project was fun and natural for me once I decided on just doing some initials.</p>

<p>In general, most of my designs are clean, modern, and minimalistic.  (At least those are the <em>good</em> words that come to mind. :)  So I was surprised when I decided I liked this design best.  After I drew it, I made a list of the things it reminded me of.  In order, they were: Tape worm, Christmas candy, measuring tape, bow on a present.  Hehe, what a logo, eh?!</p>

<h2>Illustrator</h2>

<p>I didn't have access to a scanner at the time, and my digital camera was out of juice, so I didn't make this sketch digital until later.  I just set to work in Illustrator with the pen tool.  I don't feel very comfortable in Illustrator.  I feel much more adept at Photoshop.  But, I've been determined to better myself with the Pen tool especially and learn the Illustrator environment.  Given that, I'm happy with the paths that I drew.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SqUDw.png" alt="JT paths" /></p>

<p>I only had one total restart.  This is version 2.  In planning for the gradients and just wanting to break up the path to make it easier to manage, I split the glyph into 3 separate paths.  I was just eye-balling the sketch, so it's not entirely faithful.  Most obvious, the loop on the J has a much more tight, oval loop than in the sketch.  I can't decide if I like that more or less.</p>

<h2>Final Polish</h2>

<p>With 3 separate paths, it was much easier to apply some cool-looking gradients to help give the shape some depth.  I chose yellow as the base color and orange as the shadow color.  Again, this was to match the theme.  And it is also reminiscient of a "dynaLink" logo that I did once upon a time.</p>

<p>It was a fun project.  I hope it adds a bit to the site and my other online identities (see <a href="https://twitter.com/jaketrent">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/115032056022257436849/">Google Plus</a>).</p>

<p>It's not perfect, but I wanted to ship it.  What do you like about it the most?  Or what suggestions might you have?  I'm also interested in which logos have given you the most inspiration in your work.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/paper-by-fiftythree/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-14T16:58:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/paper-by-fiftythree</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever showed up in the App Store looking for an app in a particular category and been overwhelmed at the number of choices present?  This is certainly the case for the drawing and art app category.  But, there is at least one art app that stands out clearly from the others: <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper">"Paper" by FiftyThree</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/M0kYA.jpg" alt="Paper brushes" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Best Brush</h2>

<p>The best feature of Paper is the one you get for free: the fountain pen.  It is easily the best brush I've used on any art app.  I've tried Sketchbook and Sketchbook Ink.  They are no where close.  It has the most beautiful tapered edges.  It responds best to speed and direction.  It comes the closest to a real fountain pen.</p>

<h2>Gestures</h2>

<p>The rewind/undo feature is invaluable when drawing.  It is immediately available by using two fingers.  You can activate it anywhere on screen.  This makes for very fast iterations on a drawing.  It's both intuitive and fun.</p>

<h2>Flair</h2>

<p>The app has a great style.  It's minimalistic and focused.  The notebook collection is fun.  The page flip is fun.  The UI is simple and powerful.  The focus remains on the drawing, where it should be.</p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>

<p>Sharing is straightforward and fast.  Exporting your drawings into your photo library is easy.  It's just as easy to share on the web.  Tweet with "#MadeWithPaper" and you'll show up on their <a href="http://madewithpaper.fiftythree.com/">blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<p>I get the fountain pen brush for free, and I'm happy.  You pay $2 to get each of their 4 other brushes.  The next coolest is definitely the water color brush.  It totally makes sense to pay for these top-notch brushes.  Each brush takes considerable time and effort to develop.  Other apps -- I'm looking at your Sketchbook -- might include a pile of brushes at a lower price, but they are simply not as good.</p>

<h2>Wish List</h2>

<p>There are a few things that I think the app is lacking:</p>

<ol>
<li>The color palette is too simple.  I would love more options.  Apparently this is in the works.  There are many interesting <a href="http://support.fiftythree.com/fiftythree/topics/colour_palette">suggestions for expanding the palette</a> made on their forum.  <strong>Update:</strong> The latest update has a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3002676/magical-tech-behind-paper-ipads-color-mixing-perfection">sweet color mixing tool</a>.</li>
<li>A zoom feature would be nice.  The difficult thing would be mapping it to an intuitive gesture, especially differentiating it from the super-awesome rewind gesture.  The resolution is high (2048x1536), but it sometimes doesn't feel very high given that detail work is hard without a zoom.</li>
<li>Being able to change background/paper options would be awesome.  At this point, all you start with is a plain, off-white background with no texture.  The app is called "Paper", afterall.  Wouldn't it be nice to have some more options here?</li>
</ol>


<p>The product features are well-thought and the FiftyThree team obviously has a design philosophy.  So, my pining for new features is patient.  I love what they have thus far.</p>

<h2>Magical</h2>

<p>Using Paper really has been one of the magical moments of using the iPad.  It gives a slick experience that gets me drawing fast.  There are masterful, well-honed tools that make my art look good.  The use of gestures makes great use of the direct input ability of the touch device.  I've enjoyed many hours using Paper, and I look forward to more products from FiftyThree.</p>

<p>What is your favorite feature of Paper?  Or of another art/drawing app?</p>
