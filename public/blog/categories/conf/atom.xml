    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently attended the Mountain West Ruby Conference.  It was my first time going.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the conference.  I would recommend it.</p>

<h2>Peeps</h2>

<p>I'm new to the Ruby community.  I get to use it more in my current job than I ever have before.  Whenever entering a new community, it's good to find some friends.  I was pleased to notice that everyone I encountered at the conference was very friendly and welcoming.</p>

<p>About the coolest thing about the community is one of the slogans: MINSWAN, which means "Matz is nice, so we are nice."  How cool is that?  Matz is the Ruby creator.  Wait, who am I kidding.  You already know that.</p>

<p>I was very impressed with the blatant lack of trolling other communities.  This even with the live stream video cameras rolling (people can tend to do weird things when put on camera).</p>

<p>The conference attracted speakers and attendees from as far away as Australia.</p>

<h2>Speakers</h2>

<p>I didn't look too closely at the schedule previous to attending.  Once I got there, I was surprised at the caliber of those people and companies who were represented.  These were big names in the tech community, such as Matz, himself, Github, Heroku, and others.</p>

<p>The conference is single track, so that meant I got to see everyone speak.  I mostly like that but kind of hate that.  I believe it also meant fewer speaking slots, so everyone was pretty top notch.</p>

<p>I was impressed with the stage presence of most speakers.  A few were pretty droning, but in general everyone was very polished, had good slide decks, and shared engaging and useful content.</p>

<p>Devops was the stated subject matter of an entire day of the conference.  This was cool.  We can use that kind of focus on the subject.  But then it bled into the next days as well.  I want some pure code, pure Ruby'ness.  I got some of that, but not as much as I would like.  I paid my devops dues the first day.  I was ready to not hear any more of it on days 2 and 3.</p>

<h2>Venue</h2>

<p>It was in my back yard!  I loved the lack of a hotel requirement!</p>

<p>The Salt Lake City Public Library is a great downtown location for a small conference.  In this case, with the conference being single track, the single largest room, the amphitheatre, was the only room required for all attendees.  It featured plenty of seating -- at the cost of no leg room.</p>

<p>The wifi also held up better than it has for similar gatherings in this space.  It was announced that "the city and Xmission are working feverishly" to maintain connectivity several times over the 3 days.</p>

<p>I was sorely disappointed with the lack of sugary confections meant to encourage the jollyness and attentiveness of the conference-goers.  At one point, it was necessary to slip out and find a good bakery downtown.  I was not disappointed.  I was happy to see at least the vendors' vinyl stickers come out on the last day.  We need more of that!</p>

<p>In all, it was a good use of my couple days.  It wasn't too pricey, but then, I wasn't paying.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The sky lightens with the rising sun.  Wheels are on the road.  Friends are in the car.  The leaves are changing on the towering Wasatch mountains.  Finally, we pull up to the University of Utah Institute building.  Stepping out of the car, the October air is fresh and clear, high in the Rockies.  It's a good day for a tech conference.  It's a good day for SORT.</p>

<p>SORT is an annual tech conference put on by the LDS Church.  The IT shops of the Church are all represented, including ICS, Family Search, the BYUs, CES, and probably a couple more.  Attendance last year, I think, was about 1200.</p>

<h2>Something For Everyone</h2>

<p>A unique feature of the conference is that there are soooo many subjects covered.  It's really kind of a joke the number of tracks that are represented:</p>

<ol>
<li>EIM</li>
<li>Architecture</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Engineering</li>
<li>Partner Summit</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
<li>Leadership</li>
<li>PM</li>
<li>QA</li>
<li>Requirements</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Sharepoint/CRM</li>
<li>Solution Mgmt</li>
<li>Other (misc)</li>
</ol>


<p>Holy cow!  That's a little nuts.  It started out as an engineering-only conference in 2009.  Since then, it's blossomed.  I feel like it has been a double-edged sword:  The whole office is invited and should have something to soak up there, but it feels like the engineering track has been watered down a bit.</p>

<h2>Mostly Intro</h2>

<p>The topics are varied.  It's often the case that there's so much going on that you don't know what to pick for each hour.  That is awesome!  Out of the presentations offered in the engineering track, I would love to see more intermediate or advanced topics.  More deep dives would be fun to geek out about.  I think we touch that in some cases, but in general, I feel that the presentations could be categorized as cursory introductions to topics.</p>

<h2>Free-flowing Sugar</h2>

<p>I am never lacking for ATP at SORT.  The day starts with a great breakfast.  Lunch is also delicious.  This year, both were provided by Kneaders bakery.  Between every session, there are plentiful mounds of various snack foods and refreshing beverages.  And being a conference put on by the Church, the drinks are top notch, ready for the Church membership. :)</p>

<h2>Entry to Speaking</h2>

<p>I have presented at SORT for each of the last 4 years.  You already know the bar can't be that high.  If you submit a paper, you'll probably be accepted.  I was 2 for 3 this year. :)  Some might worry that this would lower the quality of the conference material and presentation.  Yes, it probably does.  But, just like any conference, if you are a little careful in your schedule selection, you'll find some fantastic speakers and super-compelling content.</p>

<h2>A Yearly Highlight</h2>

<p>In all, SORT is a fantastic experience.  I look forward to it next year.  It's fun to review what I've learned and presented on in the past (Django, then jQuery plugins, then TDD on MarkLogic, this year BackboneJs).</p>

<p>It's at a great, close location.  The company is fantastic.  The topics are varied and interesting.  The two days are time well-spent to me.  I feel tired (a sign of lots of fire hose drinking).  I'm inspired to learn a few new things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do more CoffeeScript</li>
<li>Try SocketStream</li>
<li>Use Postgres' row_to_json</li>
<li>Try LawnChair and IndexDb</li>
<li>Do some user media capture</li>
</ol>


<p>Did any of you go this year?  What do you appreciate the most about SORT or your most recent conference?</p>
