    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to my first <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us">Fluent conf</a> this year.  It was a generally good experience.  I enjoyed the company and the topics.  Maybe I'll go again.</p>

<h2>Training</h2>

<p>I went to the one-day training before the conference, where there were half and quarter day sessions around a single topic.  I went to an awesome "Building a desktop app with Electron" training, where the content was great, the teacher, Steve Kinney, was exceptional, and I felt accomplished as we learned new things and got to create something together with my own typing fingers.  It went very quickly and probably could have been a bit more solid with even a full day of training.</p>

<p>I did two other trainings that weren't nearly as good.  The people were smart, imparting what obviously took some brains to figure out, but they weren't engaging as teachers and couldn't capture my attention well enough to make me feel like I was along for the ride.  Pre-conference prep material suggested that we'd be producing something together in these sessions as in the Electron session.  That would have been awesome.  I am a kinetic learner.  Unfortunately, there was no attempt to build upon pre-session work, and both other sessions felt dull in comparison to the morning's ride.</p>

<h2>Keynotes</h2>

<p>The mix of keynotes was great at the conference.  There were some heavy hitters: Brendan Eich and Doug Crockford.  There were some new, refreshing faces and topics from the likes of Laurie Voss and Alex Russell.  The keynotes were shorter than others I've seen -- shorter than even the other sessions.  They felt almost like lightning talks, but from big web tech personalities.  The content was varied.  The delivery was all very good.  These were high points in the conference.</p>

<h2>Sessions</h2>

<p>The sessions were mostly good.  I have a general like-dislike relationship with conference talks.  I have to remember that the point is not to be permanently changed at the end of the talk or to have immediately picked up some great new skill.  The probable best place that I can be at the end of a session is inspired, pointed in a new, interesting direction, with enough information to know what I don't know and go figure it out.</p>

<p>There was a ton of content, with 6 tracks most hours.  Some of the highlight talks that I went to were: "This talk is not available offline", by Alex Rickabaugh, talking about "Progressive Web Apps", Service Workers, and how to create a more native-like web experience; "How to write a worthwhile test", by Justin Searls, which was chock full of valuable insight for test creation and tooling; and "Building our reactive future", by Matthew Podwysocki, talking about Rx.js and how Observables are expressive coding constructs -- he was hilarious too.  I'm sure I missed some other great ones.  Should I have bought that expensive "watch the recorded videos later" package?</p>

<p>I did attend a few less-than-stellar sessions, during which I read all the docs on <a href="http://cycle.js.org/">Cycle.js</a> and worked through all the examples.  It's a super interesting framework and fit in with a large tech theme from the conference, <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html">Observables</a>.</p>

<h2>Venue</h2>

<p>San Fransisco is a fun city.  I love walking around the city.  It was unfortunately unusually overcast and drizzly weather while we were there.  We had less rain than was forecast, so that was good, and we were able to get out into the city at night.  Perhaps because of all the cloud cover, it seemed like it was always super late by the time we got out.</p>

<p>The conference was all held inside the Marriot Marquee.  It was held in the basement.  There were no windows.  Thankfully, they had good HVAC to mostly evacuate all the nerd smell.  It was funny going in the first time, because you go down about 3 flights of escalators, making it feel like you're on your way to the subway.  I don't know how many 1000+ attendees there were, but it was amazing that the hotel had that much space.  The basement must have extended underground underneath the adjoining plaza.  The Marriot was nice.  The staff were very friendly.  There was the strict policing of badge checking at most entrances -- that was annoying.</p>

<p>Getting to and from San Fransisco proved laborious with a hefty layover on the way in and a hefty delay getting out, due to weather.  This task alone made me consider just buying the virtual conference option next time.  It was fun to meet a bunch of people from all over the globe though.  Perhaps they could all come visit me in the Rocky Mountains next time, and we could party here.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>Lunches were good.  The food was good and interesting.  The lines went quickly, especially on day 2, where it seemed that they had 12 independent lines for lunch.  That was awesome.  Apparently I just got lucky the first day.  There were enough people that a proper dinner and after party didn't happen.  There was a reception the first night, which consisted of an hour of other people drinking alcohol.  I had a water.  Water from Norway never tasted so good.</p>

<h2>Swag</h2>

<p>The conference gave out water bottles.  They were on a shelf in the hall.  Oh, and they gave out name tags.  Beyond that, there was an exhibition hall with vendors giving out the usual -- stickers, t-shirts, and trinkets.  I love a good sticker and found quite a few.  Github had the best.  Codeschool had some awesome ones too, such as 80s neon "Staying Sharp with Angular".  So good.  I also replenished my summer wardrobe of T-shirts.  Heroku did go beyond T-shirts, which is a trend we should encourage, and now I have some rockin' purple socks.</p>

<h2>Going Again</h2>

<p>Fluent was a great experience and a highlight web conference for the year.  I've heard it has been even better in years past.  It's probable that I'd go again to try it out again and hope for an even better experience.  Thanks, Fluent, and I'll see you next time.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/mtnwest-javascript-review/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-25T11:45:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/mtnwest-javascript-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MountainWest JavaScript was a great conference last week.  It was a jubilee. Well, if you can have a jubilee in the first year of a conference.   Here's my take.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VGtnQzX.png" alt="MtnWest JavaScript" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Format</h2>

<p><a href="http://mtnwestjs.org/">MountainWest JavaScript</a> started this year as a part of the larger Mountain West conference set, including <a href="http://mtnwestdevops.org/">devops</a> and <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/">Ruby</a> as well.  It was two full days.  There is a single track -- everyone (that stays) hears everything.  Love both these features.  Splitting the disciplines into separate conferences is genius.</p>

<h2>Speakers</h2>

<p>The speaker lineup was exceptional.  There were many great minds assembled, fun experience shared, and great companies represented.  Following <a href="/post/ng-conf-review/">ng-conf</a> earlier this year, I was again pleasantly surprised at the amount of great content.  I did not attend the devops or ruby portions, but it has been said by some that they were not as exceptional.</p>

<p>Thanks to the organizers for selecting great content and presenters.  Thank you to all the speakers for preparing some killer talks.</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<p>The mix of topics seemed relevant and varied.  This was welcome.  There was just a bit of overlap on some topics.  Conference organizers put similar topics together, which was fine.  But in one case, the back-to-back speakers, from the same company and essentially the same topic had so much overlap that it was obvious.  Repetition is good, but it should be done in front of the YouTube recording of a single, great talk on the subject.  The conference was recorded, so hopefully we can see the sessions online soon.</p>

<h2>Venue</h2>

<p>The conference met at the Salt Lake City Public Library.  It's a great city.  It's a cool building.  It has a location close to public transit lines.  The stadium seating in the conference room is good for visibility but bad for knees.  There were plenty of power sources.</p>

<p>Despite these good points about the location, I found myself not super-excited about showing up at the library for another conference.  I feel like it's time for something fresh.</p>

<h2>Swag</h2>

<p>There was a nice shirt with mysterious symbols emblazened across the front.  Ruby was discernable.  I'm still up in the air over which represents JavaScript or devops.  There was also a nice, laminate sticker that they gave out with the conference logo.  Sponsors gave out nothing.  I was hoping for an O.C. Tanner gold bracelet and Instructure panda hoodie.  There was also a stunning lack of sweet treats and lunch. :(  In the place of actual food, there was an especially long, 2-hour lunch break -- oh, and a lot of water.</p>

<h2>I'd Go Again</h2>

<p>I'd definitely go again if the speaker and topic lineup seemed as promising as it turned out to be this year.  Next year, hopefully I'll attend at a different location in Salt Lake City and enjoy a chocolate eclair whilst learning about how I can actually use es6 features in the then-current evergreen browsers.</p>

<h2>My Notes</h2>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/ng-conf-review/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-24T07:22:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/ng-conf-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ng-Conf just happened last week in Salt Lake City, Utah.  It was awesome.  Oh blast, I blew the punch line.  Anyway, here's my take.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4swtO6x.jpg" alt="ng-conf" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Format</h2>

<p>Two days.  Early 'til late.  One track.  20-40 min talks virtually back to back.  Lightning'y?  When we broke for lunch, I felt relieved.  My brain could go into some low-power mode.  Breaks between talks were mostly announced as anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes, this whilst yammering off a short list of swag winners.  The format encouraged content, and there was a lot of it!</p>

<h2>Line Up</h2>

<p>The conference was easy to look forward to.  Looking at the speaker list, I was immediately impressed.  At one point during the event, Aaron Frost said that they hoped if the Angular team would come that they'd get more attendees.  Yes, that was a draw.  It was fun having them there.  Core.  Very core.  I believe that about each member of the team took the stage over the two days.</p>

<p>The speaker list in total was very impressive.  There was a good mix of local and remote talent who came together to cover a broad array of Angular and JavaScript-related topics.</p>

<h2>Talk Quality</h2>

<p>Talk for talk, just numbers-wise, it was definitely one of the most high quality conferences I've attended.  Of course, there were some less-than-stellar presentations.  But, on the whole, I was more than impressed by the subject mastery and teaching ability of the speakers.  Thank you to everyone who prepared.</p>

<p>There were also some definite highlights: Dave Smith on directives, Vojta Jina on DI, Brian Ford on zone.js, and Julie Ralph on Protractor.</p>

<p>And one of the best parts is that each of these talks was recorded on video for a livestream and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ngconfvideos">on youtube for later viewing</a>.</p>

<h2>Venue</h2>

<p>The conference was held at the Little America hotel in Salt Lake City.  It was a beautiful location.  The combined main ballrooms that the talks were held in were awesome.  Plenty of marble.  The food was great.  There weren't tons of snacks, but that was probably good for my health.  The air quality in Salt Lake during the conference wasn't good.  In fact, oobleck!  But, I didn't get food poisoning -- plus!</p>

<h2>Smooth</h2>

<p>I heard it said by multiple people during the conference that it was the best first-time conference they had attended.  Indeed, everything went Domo smooth.  The content was the star.  It was fun.  It was energetic (minus some confusing lack of screaming for all the sweet swag -- probably had something to do with the sheer amount, like clapping for the 3rd curtain call).  The AV crew did a fantastic job.  Usually, it's annoying to sit in an audience as video or audio problems plague the start of a talk.  That simply did not happen here, and it was oh, so refreshing.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and sweet jacket!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[UtahJS Conf 2013 Review]]></title>
    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/utahjs-conf-2013-review/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-20T06:59:00-06:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/G3BBShC.png" alt="UtahJS" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Schedule</h2>

<p>The conference covered a single day.  Keynote in the morning by Tom Dale, co-creator of Emberjs.  3 tracks thereafter with 5 talks each.  There was a specialized track, all focused on Angular, which was nice for anyone that wanted to focus on that framework.  There was less Node focus overall compared to last year, which was disappointing.  There were 3 talks focused on testing.  We need more good testing talks.</p>

<p>My impression on the talks overall was that they were well done and that the speakers were generally engaging.  The topics focused a little much on browser-side MV* frameworks, but I guess that's hot right now.  Every talk I went to was meant for beginners at a very introductory level.  That was disappointing.  Of the topics presented, I found myself surprisingly most interested in Emberjs.  I have been tinkering with it since then and need to build something with it.</p>

<h2>The Food</h2>

<p>There was a plentitude of simple carbohydrates ready to serve to all learners at all times.  That was awesome.  Pastries appeared for breakfast, un-advertised.  They didn't do a boxed lunch this year.  Some didn't cry.  I almost did.  But I was pointed to a great gryo at a nearby Greek eatery instead.  Apparently the host venue, the Salt Lake City Public Library, didn't approve of serving food.  This, I don't understand, given that there was plenty of food floating around.  Apparenly pastries are ok, and sandwiches are not.</p>

<h2>The People</h2>

<p>Always a fun flavor to a conference, the attendees were great to mingle with.  The JavaScript community is a fun group to be with.  In Utah, we're a fairly small, tight group.  It was fun to have Tom Dale show up.  It was even said by some that the Ember folks were "actually nice" as opposed to what was thought to be observed by some on Twitter.  Haha.  I smiled quite a bit when I heard that.</p>

<h2>The Afterparty</h2>

<p>The party was put on by O.C. Tanner and Domo.  O.C. Tanner is my current home base.  We were in charge of prepping the space.  It was like a classic text adventure trying to guide party-comers through the labyrinth of the O.C. Tanner building to the eventual pot of gold that was the party.</p>

<p>The food never stopped coming, even after my stomach had taken on its full capacity.  Marvelous Catering (gotta love that name) provided a delicious "luau pork dinner".  I heard "luau" and assumed pineapple, of which there was none, which disappointed me just a little.  The owner of Fongo Bongo, a local game shop supplied a great collection of board and card games.  We had a couple Xboxen humming whilst TVs blasted fighting games to which I knew no combos.  We had a great time.</p>

<h2>Next Year</h2>

<p>I'm glad that this event has shown some perpetuity.  I hope it continues next year.  I think they have a good formula.  The price, the locale, the speaker lineup, and the associated activities make for a good one-day experience each Spring.  I would focus on improving one bit next year: the website.  It was the least well-done part of the conference.  I find that extremely ironic given the target market for the event.</p>

<p>So next Spring, come to Utah and attend the JsConf.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Mountain West Ruby Conf 2013 Review]]></title>
    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/mountain-west-ruby-conf-2013-review/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-05T15:23:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/mountain-west-ruby-conf-2013-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently attended the Mountain West Ruby Conference.  It was my first time going.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the conference.  I would recommend it.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ABNr5MC.jpg" alt="Mountain West Ruby Conf" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Peeps</h2>

<p>I'm new to the Ruby community.  I get to use it more in my current job than I ever have before.  Whenever entering a new community, it's good to find some friends.  I was pleased to notice that everyone I encountered at the conference was very friendly and welcoming.</p>

<p>About the coolest thing about the community is one of the slogans: MINSWAN, which means "Matz is nice, so we are nice."  How cool is that?  Matz is the Ruby creator.  Wait, who am I kidding.  You already know that.</p>

<p>I was very impressed with the blatant lack of trolling other communities.  This even with the live stream video cameras rolling (people can tend to do weird things when put on camera).</p>

<p>The conference attracted speakers and attendees from as far away as Australia.</p>

<h2>Speakers</h2>

<p>I didn't look too closely at the schedule previous to attending.  Once I got there, I was surprised at the caliber of those people and companies who were represented.  These were big names in the tech community, such as Matz, himself, Github, Heroku, and others.</p>

<p>The conference is single track, so that meant I got to see everyone speak.  I mostly like that but kind of hate that.  I believe it also meant fewer speaking slots, so everyone was pretty top notch.</p>

<p>I was impressed with the stage presence of most speakers.  A few were pretty droning, but in general everyone was very polished, had good slide decks, and shared engaging and useful content.</p>

<p>Devops was the stated subject matter of an entire day of the conference.  This was cool.  We can use that kind of focus on the subject.  But then it bled into the next days as well.  I want some pure code, pure Ruby'ness.  I got some of that, but not as much as I would like.  I paid my devops dues the first day.  I was ready to not hear any more of it on days 2 and 3.</p>

<h2>Venue</h2>

<p>It was in my back yard!  I loved the lack of a hotel requirement!  Apparently some visitors even camped in the wilderness, Nacho style.</p>

<p>The Salt Lake City Public Library is a great downtown location for a small conference.  In this case, with the conference being single track, the single largest room, the amphitheatre, was the only room required for all attendees.  It featured plenty of seating -- at the cost of no leg room.</p>

<p>The wifi also held up better than it has for similar gatherings in this space.  It was announced that "the city and Xmission are working feverishly" to maintain connectivity several times over the 3 days.  It still didn't stay up.  This is a common tech conf occurrence.</p>

<p>I was sorely disappointed with the lack of sugary confections meant to encourage the jollyness and attentiveness of the conference-goers.  At one point, it was necessary to slip out and find a good bakery downtown.  I was not disappointed.  I was happy to see at least the vendors' vinyl stickers come out on the last day.  We need more of that!</p>

<p>In all, it was a good use of my couple days.  It wasn't too pricey, but then, I wasn't paying.</p>
