    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sintra</a> is a light web server that's easy to start writing Ruby on.  Coming from Node/Express, I feel quite at home there.  Slim also feels like another JavaScript-world templating language, Jade, that I've had good experiences with.  <a href="http://slim-lang.com/">Slim</a> makes for quick templating and feels quite nice compared to ERB if you can handle the Haml style.  It's likewise quick and easy to get working on Sinatra.</p>

<h2>Quick Sinatra Setup</h2>

<h4>Require Sinatra</h4>

<p>Sinatra is super easy to setup.  Create a <code>Gemfile</code> with the dependencies as follows:</p>

<p>```ruby
source "http://rubygems.org"</p>

<p>gem "sinatra"
gem "thin"
```</p>

<p>Then create a default <code>web.rb</code> webserver with contents that look something like:</p>

<p>```ruby
require "sinatra"</p>

<p>get "/" do
  "Hello, world!"
end
```</p>

<p>Then if you run the command:</p>

<p><code>
$ ruby web.rb
</code></p>

<p>You should get a startup message like:</p>

<p>```
== Sinatra/1.3.4 has taken the stage on 4567 for development with backup from Thin</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>Thin web server (v1.5.0 codename Knife)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on 0.0.0.0:4567, CTRL+C to stop
```</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Go to <code>localhost:4567</code> in your browser to try out your server.</p>

<h4>Require Slim</h4>

<p>Returning a string is all well and good, but let's include Slim to be able to create more sophisticated templates. Include your Slim dependency in your <code>Gemfile</code> with the line:</p>

<p><code>ruby
gem "slim"
</code></p>

<p>Then from the Terminal, run:</p>

<p><code>
$ bundle install
</code></p>

<h4>Setup your Views</h4>

<p>Then create a directory next to your <code>web.rb</code> file called <code>views</code>.  Inside <code>views</code>, you can create your templates.  You can create a layout template aptly named <code>layout.slim</code>.  By default, your templates will extend from this layout.  Most simply, these files might look like this:</p>

<p>layout.slim:</p>

<p>```haml
doctype html
html
  head</p>

<pre><code>title My Slim Templates App
</code></pre>

<p>  body</p>

<pre><code>= yield
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>And, index.slim:</p>

<p><code>haml
h1 Loving Slim
</code></p>

<h4>Serve a Slim File</h4>

<p>And now to adjust our <code>web.rb</code> file to serve the new <code>index.slim</code> file:</p>

<p>```ruby
require "sinatra"
require "slim"</p>

<p>get "/" do
  slim :index
end
```</p>

<p>Finally restart your server, and you should see your new template shown in all it's glory.  Pretty easy cheesy.</p>

<h2>Setup Slim on Rails</h2>

<p>Want something even easier?  Well, if you know <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> already, this will be a cinch.  The hardest part of getting Slim running on Rails is Rails itself.  Slim integration is even easier than on Sinatra.  Simply add this line to your Gemfile:</p>

<p><code>
gem "slim-rails"
</code></p>

<p>And then in order to activate the Slim handler, merely add the <code>.slim</code> extension onto the end of any of your template file names.  Your file names probably end in <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html"><code>.erb</code> by default</a>.  Change the ones that you want to convert to Slim templates to look like:</p>

<p><code>
index.html.slim
</code></p>

<p>Now the Rails are even slicker.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/jumpstartlab-ruby-training-review/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-19T07:06:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/jumpstartlab-ruby-training-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Lab</a> offers a <a href="http://www.jumpstartlab.com/courses/">Ruby training</a>.  I recently attended.  I had a great experience and learned a lot in my first real introduction to Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  I would highly recommend the course.  Here are a few more details on my experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DniDljD.png" alt="Jumpstart Lab" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Format</h2>

<h4>Length</h4>

<p>Jumpstart sent a great instructor, <a href="https://twitter.com/franklinwebber">Franklin Webber</a>, to come lead us through the exercises.  The course was on site at our company.  It was 5 days in length.  Instruction went from 9am to 4pm daily, with a 1 hour break at lunch time.</p>

<h4>Breaks</h4>

<p>Exercises throughout the day were split up into 25 min time chunks with 5 min breaks following.  Some will recognize this usual time chunks for the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a>.  Frank, as the leader of the exercises, was more strict in his observance of the Pomodoro time slices than I'm used to seeing.  Many people I've worked with would work right through a short break, but we took breaks quite religiously.</p>

<h4>Content Split</h4>

<p>In our 5 day training, we spent about the first 3 days going over vanilla Ruby.  The next 2 days, we focused on the Ruby on Rails framework specifically.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<h4>TDD</h4>

<p>Probably about the coolest aspect of this training was its relying on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> to get stuff done.  Often training courses, especially those that introduce brand new languages and concepts, leave testing as a tack-on feature, meantioned in parting near the end of the course.  Thankfully, Jumpstart did a great job integrating this best practice into most of its instruction.</p>

<p>We used <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">Rspec</a> as a test runner.  We used <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a> to help us go faster through our test iterations.  We discussed what to test, how to make our tests more readable, how to isolate tests using <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/docs">mocks</a>, and practiced doing lots of tests.</p>

<p>Only the Rails portion of the course was taught using error-driven development.  This actually worked quite well, as learning to use a framework requires learning how the pieces connect and trying not to test the framework.</p>

<h4>Instructor-Led</h4>

<p>Frank made the class successful.  He is super knowledgeable about the subject matter.  He is fun and funny.  He is great at introducing topics that built upon each other.  He is great at letting the students figure things out for themselves and jumping in at the right moment to help clear hurdles.  It was great to meet and work with Frank, and I hope to do so again.</p>

<h2>Bonuses</h2>

<h4>Hack Night</h4>

<p>We do a <a href="http://tannerhack.eventbrite.com/">hack night</a> every other week at work anyway.  Since Frank was here, he led the hack night.  We did a Codemash kata exercise where we created code to generate a <a href="https://github.com/jaketrent/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a> board.  We split into teams and pair-programmed our different solutions.  Everyone came up with unique solutions, we compared them, and then iterated.  I had so much fun with the exercise, I put a frontend on the game and made it <a href="http://minemopper.herokuapp.com">playable</a>.</p>

<h4>Tutorial Content</h4>

<p>Jumpstart printed materials for us in a booklet.  The <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com">tutorials</a> are also available online.  Frank took a unique path through the content, and we talked through our specific approach.  As he worked, Frank also <a href="https://github.com/burtlo/training-021113">uploaded the code</a> from our instruction to Github.  I did the same for <a href="http://github.com/jaketrent/ruby-training">my code</a>.</p>

<h4>Recommendation</h4>

<p>I think that this training series was about the best I've attended.  I'm doing a lot more Ruby and Rails in my current job than I expected even a few weeks ago, so it was very timely and useful for me.  The content was good, but it was the instruction that made it top notch.  Thanks, Frank and Jumpstart, for the great experience!</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/multiple-yields-in-erb-template/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-08T07:13:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/multiple-yields-in-erb-template</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you setup a new Rails project, you'll have a single layout file which has a single default <code>yield</code> block.  This will soon be inadequate, and you'll want another.  Here's how to setup multiple <code>yield</code> blocks per ERB template.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YqUKEfw.png" alt="Multiple ERB yields" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Layout File</h2>

<p>By default, Rails will create a file at:</p>

<p><code>
app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
</code></p>

<p>In this file, there will be a default <code>yield</code> block similar to this:</p>

<p><code>ruby
&lt;%= yield %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>It has no name.  It's just the default place for templates that use this layout file to put their content.</p>

<p>We can create new <code>yield</code> blocks.  We'll have to give them a distinguishing name.  They look about the same.  If I wanted to create a new <code>yield</code> block where, for instance, alerts could be displayed if the child template had them, I could put this in my layout file:</p>

<p><code>ruby
&lt;%= yield(:alert) %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Now I would just need something to go in it.</p>

<h2>Child Templates</h2>

<p>A child template that uses the <code>application.html.erb</code> layout file can just start blasting out markup that will go into the default <code>yield</code> block.  This will usually be the main content.  But in our example, there might be more focused content such as alerts that we want to display in a separate area.  Thus, our template could potentially look like this:</p>

<p>```erb</p>

<h1>My main content</h1>


<p>Bacon ipsum…<p>

<% content_for :alert do %>
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    You created multiple yield blocks!
  </div>
<% end %>
```

Throw down a `content_for` block, matching the name of the `yield` block in your layout file, and you're set.  Order does not matter.  Your specific `content_for` blocks can come before, after, or in the middle of your main content.  Easy as Ruby pie.

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/rename-files-in-asset-pipeline/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-06T07:06:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/rename-files-in-asset-pipeline</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rails provides a powerful mechanism for preparing your site's static assets for the web.  It's called the asset pipeline.  True to Rails, it has sensible defaults.  Also true to form, it's not immediately clear what's required to change from the defaults.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HPJDXPB.jpg" alt="Asset Pipeline" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Multiple Compilers</h2>

<p>The asset pipeline has the ability to pass your static assets through multiple compilers.  Thus, they seem much less static than they might be.  The compilers used are determined by the file extension.  For instance, this file:</p>

<p><code>
myscripts.js.coffee.erb
</code></p>

<p>Will go through the Erb compiler first, then the Coffeescript compiler, then finally will output pure JavaScript.</p>

<p>Changing these files are no problem.  Want a new compiler?  Slap on a new file extension.  Don't need one?  Remove it.</p>

<h2>Manifest File</h2>

<p>Manifest files are full of Sprocket directives.  Sprockets will use these files to combine and minify your css and js.  A manifest will look something like this:</p>

<p><code>
//= require vendor/jquery
//= require vendor/angular.min
//= require vendor/angular-cookies
</code></p>

<p>These directives identify what files will eventually be combined, replacing the contents of your manifest file in the final output.</p>

<p>If you change the name of scripts or stylesheets, you need to ensure that your manifest file is changed to match.  Otherwise, asset precompilation will fail.</p>

<p>By default the manifest filenames are these:</p>

<p><code>
app/assets/javascripts/application.js
app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
</code></p>

<h2>Changing Manifest Filenames</h2>

<p>Changing the manifest default filenames will require some tweaking.</p>

<p>For instance, if I change application.js to be split into two separate manifest files, <code>scripts-foot.js</code> and <code>scripts-head.js</code>, the next time I run:</p>

<p><code>
rake assets:precompile
</code></p>

<p>It will succceed, and everything will look like it's just fine.  But when I go to run the app, it will give my an error like:</p>

<p>```
ActionView::Template::Error (scripts-head.js isn't precompiled):</p>

<p>2013-02-04T16:24:05+00:00 app[web.1]: app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:14:in `_app_views_layouts_application_html_erb__3761578772688930207_28706600'
```</p>

<p>When you switch from the default manifest files or when you reference a static asset like a js or css directly from your view, you'll need to mark it as explicitly requiring precompilation.</p>

<p>This is done in an environment file, such as <code>config/environments/production.rb</code>:</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>Precompile additional assets (application.js, application.css, and all non-JS/CSS are already added)</h1>

<p>config.assets.precompile += %w( scripts-foot.js scripts-head.js )
```</p>

<p>It's that easy.  It's too bad you have to wait until the app runs to discover this is a problem.  But now you're ready.</p>

<p>Now if we could only customize the directory structure under <code>app/assets</code>.  I would much rather use the path <code>js/</code> instead of <code>javascripts/</code>.  Does anyone know how?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/run-pow-server-on-vm/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-31T16:14:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/run-pow-server-on-vm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's really pretty cool how easy <a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a> makes running a Rails server.  <a href="https://github.com/rodreegez/powder">Powder</a> makes it even easier.  Here's how to run your Rails server via Pow on a VM in order to test IE.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XdExdtS.jpg" alt="Pow Server" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Install Pow</h2>

<p>Get your Ruby environment otherwise setup for Rails dev. Then install <a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a>.  It's a nice little utility created by the folks at 37 Signals.  They have a short little install script you can run, as <a href="http://pow.cx/">referenced on the Pow site</a>.  Or, you can use a utility created to make it <em>even easier</em> -- <a href="https://github.com/rodreegez/powder">powder</a>.</p>

<p>To install, you'll need <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems</a> installed, and run:</p>

<p><code>
$ gem install powder
</code></p>

<p>Then link your project to Pow via the command:</p>

<p><code>
$ cd &lt;my_proj_dir&gt;
$ powder link
</code></p>

<p>Make sure Pow is running:</p>

<p><code>
$ powder up
</code></p>

<p>And access your Pow-powered site by going to your project's address in your browser:</p>

<p><code>
http://&lt;my_project_dir&gt;.dev
</code></p>

<p>There are other options in the <code>powder link</code> step.  For instance, if you want to access your site through an http address different than <code>&lt;my_proj_dir&gt;</code> you can specify that.</p>

<h2>Install your VM</h2>

<p>There are a few different VM options.  My favorite is <a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>.  It does hurt a bit seeing the "Oracle" moniker on it, but I've found it to be as responsive as a VM can be and generally stable.</p>

<h2>Install Internet Explorer</h2>

<p>There really wasn't another reason that you wanted a Windows VM was there?</p>

<p>I've had good success with  the project <a href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms">xdissent/ievms</a>.  To download the IE-ready images, the README invites us to run this script in our shell:</p>

<p><code>
curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | bash
</code></p>

<p>It will download multiple parts of several Windows/IE VM images into <code>~/.ievms</code> and install them so they're ready to roll with VirtualBox.  Run this way, images for Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, and 9 are all downloaded.  If you wanted to just download IE 9, you could run:</p>

<p><code>
curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="9" bash
</code></p>

<p>Either way, this download takes quite a while to complete, but the shell script that's running it takes pretty good care of you, restarting on the last incomplete download part.</p>

<h2>Access Pow via VirtualBox</h2>

<p>Accessing Pow in the VM isn't bad at all.  Pow makes use of <a href="http://xip.io">xip.io</a>, which provides a wildcard DNS entry used by Pow and thus your app.</p>

<p>For the <a href="http://pow.cx/manual.html#section_2.1.5">next step</a>, take note of your IP by running <code>ifconfig</code>.  Then from IE inside of VirtualBox, point your browser at:</p>

<p><code>
http://&lt;my_proj_dir&gt;.&lt;my_ip&gt;.xip.io
</code></p>

<p>And you should see your project running in the VM just as you do from your better, native OS.  Pow!</p>
