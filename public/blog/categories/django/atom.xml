    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Django comes with some awesome CLI tools.  Manage.py is a beast of magic and lore.  And it loves the fantastical kingdom of Heroku, where is romps with merry measure twixt the ether.  But, when I've tried to go through a dumpdata of a previous site, syncdb on a migration to Heroku, and loaddata for moving the data, I've run into a snag on django_content_type_app_label_key more than once.  Here are some resolutions.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Error Stack</h2>

<p>Specifically, when I do a sync of the database:</p>

<p><code>bash
heroku run python manage.py syncdb
</code></p>

<p>It works like a charm.  And then a loading of the data:</p>

<p><code>bash
heroku run python manage.py loaddata data.json
</code></p>

<p>It runs for a bit then spews this small hiccup:</p>

<p>```bash
Running python manage.py loaddata data.json attached to terminal... up, run.2
Problem installing fixture 'data.json': Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py", line 174, in handle</p>

<pre><code>obj.save(using=using)
</code></pre>

<p>  # ...more stack trace...
  File "/app/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/db/backends/postgresql_psycopg2/base.py", line 44, in execute</p>

<pre><code>return self.cursor.execute(query, args)
</code></pre>

<p>IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "django_content_type_app_label_key"
```
Lovely.</p>

<p>It turns out that <code>syncdb</code>, in addition to running the DDLs for your table creation also populates the <code>django_content_type</code> table.  And then when you loaddata it tries to repopulate the table, violating the unique constraint on the content type name.</p>

<h2>Make the Magic Live Again</h2>

<p>There are a couple ways around this:</p>

<h3>Dump Something Specific</h3>

<p>When you dumpdata, only <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#dumpdata-appname-appname-appname-model">dump specific apps</a> instead of the whole project.  For example:</p>

<p><code>bash
python manage.py dumpdata myApp
</code></p>

<h3>Django 1.3 Exclude</h3>

<p>If you're on Django 1.3 or above, you get a nice new option with dumpdata to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-option---exclude">exclude certain apps</a>.  So you could run:</p>

<p><code>bash
python manage.py dumpdata --exclude contenttypes
</code></p>

<h3>Try in Vain to Reset</h3>

<p>Another one I tried (but didn't work) was:</p>

<p><code>bash
heroku run python aprilandjake/manage.py reset contenttypes
</code></p>

<h3>Sql Truncate</h3>

<p>Or, if you're still trying to dumpdata on your whole project, you could <code>syncdb</code> on Heroku and then truncate the data out of <code>django_content_type</code> like this:</p>

<p><code>bash
heroku run python aprilandjake/manage.py dbshell
</code></p>

<p>And then <a href="http://swik.net/django/Django+Community+Aggregator?page=2">truncate</a> (inside the dbshell):</p>

<p><code>bash
truncate django_content_type cascade;    
</code></p>

<p>Problem for me is that didn't work either.  I am on the super cheap in Heroku, so I get this lovely denial:</p>

<p><code>bash
Running python manage.py dbshell attached to terminal... up, run.5
Error: You appear not to have the 'psql' program installed or on your path.
</code></p>

<p>(It's not available in a <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql">shared database</a>):</p>

<p><code>bash
heroku pg:psql
!  Cannot ingress to a shared database
</code></p>

<h3>Delete via Admin UI</h3>

<p>And finally, if you want to get rid of the data via the admin UI, set it up to appear as editable.  In an <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-objects"><code>admin.py</code></a> in your project, try something like this:</p>

<p>```python
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType</p>

<p>class ContentTypeAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
  list_display = ['name', 'app_label']
  fieldsets = (</p>

<pre><code>('', {
  'classes': ('',),
  'fields': ('name', 'app_label')
}),
</code></pre>

<p>  )</p>

<p>  admin.site.register(ContentType, ContentTypeAdmin)
```</p>

<p>Now you should be able to loaddata and feel the Django wind in your hair and the Heroku grass beneath your feet again.</p>

    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/django-loaddata-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Django's manage.py script comes with some great utilitarian commands.  Two of my favorites are dumpdata and loaddata.  I've used these commands recently to migrate a Django app's data to the same Django app now running on Heroku.  Here's a little taste of the glory.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is awesome.  <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is awesome.  <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django>">Combined</a> they are awesomeerest.</p>

<p>First, get your data out of your existing Django app with manage.py's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#dumpdata-appname-appname-appname-model">dumpdata</a>:</p>

<p><code>bash
python manage.py dumpddata --natural --indent 2 &gt; data.json
</code></p>

<p>By default it comes out as json, but you can <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-option---format>">change that</a>.  The two options used above have now become common-place for me, providing:</p>

<ul>
<li>"--natural" - use this baby for when you dump contrib.contenttypes ContentType.  Since we're taking the whole db, odds are that you're using it, since most interesting django apps do.</li>
<li>"--indent" - make it human-readable instead of a single-liner.</li>
</ul>


<p>The "> data.json" is just some Unix'y redirect goodness to stash the output of your dumpdata command in the data.json file.</p>

<p>Now you want to get your data.json into the db of your Heroku-based Django app.  Heroku allows you the ability to run <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/oneoff-admin-ps">one-off processes</a> such as the loaddata command.  But the next hurdle will be getting your data.json onto the Heroku server.  This is always handled in a git push.  And to make it a little bit more interesting, let's say that the code you have isn't particularly sensitive, but the data is.  So, we're going to commit the data.json, push it, remove the latest git commit, be able to push our code to the origin server, and still run loaddata on Heroku.  Sheesh.</p>

<p>Ok, so commit your file:</p>

<p><code>bash
git add data.json
git commit -m "Added data"
</code></p>

<p>Push it to Heroku:</p>

<p><code>bash
git push heroku master
</code></p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/git-undo-last-commit/927386#927386">Remove commit</a>:</p>

<p><code>bash
git reset --soft HEAD^
</code></p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1505948/how-do-i-remove-a-single-file-from-the-staging-area-of-git-but-not-remove-it-fro/1505968#1505968">Remove file</a> from staging area:</p>

<p><code>bash
git reset HEAD data.json
</code></p>

<p>Save your code w/o data included:</p>

<p><code>bash
git push origin master
</code></p>

<p>And now you should still have data.json on your Heroku server and be able to run loaddata:</p>

<p><code>bash
heroku run python manage.py loaddata data.json
</code></p>

<p>If it all works, your data fixtures should be found and you should see a confirmation message that they were loaded into the db.  Just like a dream.  The only thing that would make it better is if you never had to commit data.json at all.  Too bad Heroku couldn't pick up local file input like it can pick up STDIN in a 'heroku run' command!</p>

<h2>Update: Force Next Push</h2>

<p>Also note that if you continue to commit to git locally on future enhancements to your app and then want to push again to Heroku, you'll likely get an error message:</p>

<p><code>bash
git push heroku master
To git@heroku.com:myProject.git
 ! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@heroku.com:myProject.git'
To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
</code></p>

<p>To get around this, next time you push to Heroku, try:</p>

<p><code>bash
git push heroku master -f
</code></p>

<p>And force it to do your bidding.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/jquery-ajax-json-django/"/>
    <updated>2011-01-27T16:36:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/jquery-ajax-json-django</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jquery, Ajax, Json, Django -- this is quite a laundry list of technologies.  In fact, it's pretty much the whole stack: client tech, server requests, over-the-network data format, and a backend app server.  In the following slidedeck and example code, we're going to touch on the whole stack and not get too deep into any one area.  By the end, you should be able to at least have a grasp of what technologies one can use in an Ajax Django application, a little bit of what they're capable of, and then, hopefully, a list in your brain that you can go back, reference, and then drill into specific technologies when you want to go build something similar yourself.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Here's the breakdown of the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rockycode/jquery-ajax-json-on-django">slideshare slidedeck</a>:</p>

<h2>Jquery</h2>

<ul>
<li>A Javascript framework</li>
<li>"Write less, do more"</li>
<li>Select the dom - $(".selection")</li>
<li>Traverse the dom - $(".my").parent()</li>
<li>Manipulate the dom - $(".my").append("dectomy")</li>
<li>Provides an Ajax API - $.ajax()</li>
<li>Framework for providing your own functionality (plugins) - $(".new").operate()</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ajax</h2>

<ul>
<li>Asynchronous Javascript and Xml</li>
<li>Jquery API - $.ajax(), $.get(), $.post(), $.getJSON()</li>
</ul>


<h2>Json</h2>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript Object Notation</li>
<li>Terse</li>
<li>Flexible, nestable</li>
<li>Native in Javascript</li>
</ul>


<h2>Django</h2>

<ul>
<li>Web framework built on Python</li>
<li>"encourages... clean, pragmatic design"</li>
<li>Django-piston - mini-framework to create RESTful APIs for your data</li>
</ul>


<p>Because this presentation was originally written for a Django-loving audience who wanted to know more about Jquery, Ajax, and Json, I decided to make the most basic Django app that could easily function with the other (mostly) client-based technologies.</p>

<h2>Sample App</h2>

<p>The result was the "ask" app (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jtsnake/ask>">source here</a>).  In the app, we have what is basically an FAQ.  Previously on the Internetz somewhere, I saw a fun FAQ where two people answered every question and almost the most fun thing for me was comparing the answers of the two people to one another.  The difference in their answers was often humorous and entertaining in addition to answering the question.  The questions were also often ridiculous.  This seemed like a fun format, so I asked my friend, <a href="http://rockycode.com/blog/author/steveo/">Steve</a> to answer a few questions with me, and we created the app.  Techs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">Jquery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/">Jquery Templates</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/">Sammy.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Home">django-piston</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a></li>
</ul>


<p>On the backend, django-piston allows us to easily define handlers for the data that we want to expose through a RESTful API.  We define the urls to get to the handlers at, and boom!, we have json-flavored data being queried by Django, and displayed to requesters at the defined urls.</p>

<p>From here, we're very client heavy.</p>

<h2>Jquery Templates</h2>

<p>Jquery gives us an easy api to $.get() the data that we want.  We use Jquery Templates to do what Django templates may normally do for us:  Apply markup to our dynamic data.  With Jquery Templates, the server can send almost-raw data and the client, which seems to be a naturally fitting place for presentation transformation anyway, can now be fully in charge of what markup data should be displayed within.</p>

<h2>Sammy.js</h2>

<p>We also used just a portion of Sammy.js, the routing feature, to take care of the controller logic.  I like the Sammy.js routing for the same reason that I like the Django urls.py routing: it's very imperative, which I feel is elegant:  "Here's my url pattern, and here's the logic that goes with that."</p>

<h2>Why SOUIT</h2>

<p><a href="http://souit.org/">SOUIT</a> = Service-oriented User Interface Technology.  Why would we want to create an app like this?  Doesn't Django have the ability to do this all for me -- url routing, templating?  It does.  But that doesn't mean that it wouldn't be more fitting to have this happen elsewhere, if only partially.  Since browsers are becoming beefier and more capable of handling client side transformations like templating and with tools like Jquery and Sammy that make request and response routing very clean, why not try it there?  Throw in the requirement of "asynchronous"ity, and you may just be happy you have the ability to do all this on the client.  And it's cool -- worth an additional 5 points.  Plus, now that our web client is essentially a single-page app with all the smarts it needs to function, we can consider different backend technologies too.  Hmmm, a database that exposes its data through mere REST APIs?  CouchDb, maybe?</p>

<p>What do you think?  This example 'ask' application is definitely not extremely compelling, but what are the best uses of this particular client-heavy technology stack that you can think of?</p>

<p>As is discussed in the slide deck, and hence the subtitle of the presentation, much could be helped by more careful reading of documentation.  Well, moments ago, I decided that I hadn't checked out django-jython 1.1.  Well.... turns out many more problems could have been helped by using this later version.  Sweet!</p>
