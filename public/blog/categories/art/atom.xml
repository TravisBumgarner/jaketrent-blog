    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A logo is an essential part of a brand or image.  For me, I like something iconic that is captured through an eye catching image that is simple and elegant.  Logos have to be one of the visual elements that I enjoy watching others' creativity in the most.  For JakeTrent.com, one of the goals has been to <a href="http://jaketrent.com/post/why-i-chose-a-wordpress-blog/">write on it more and customize it less</a>.  So, far I've met that goal.  But I really couldn't let this otherwise nice <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/living-journal">LivingJournal</a> theme sit without adding a bit of pizazz of my own.  So, here's how I created the logo.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>I would say that my logo is a confluence of 3 other logos.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="http://trentwalton.com/">Trent Walton</a> logo - It is minimalistic.  Initials for personal sites seems to be all the rage anyway.  It seems to be fitting
2.<a href="http://thenextweb.com/">The Next Web</a>logo - I loved how the type connected.  It's very clean.  I almost went with red, but the site here has an accent color of yellow.  So in the end I went with that instead.</li>
<li>Another conference or software logo - I really can't remember which it is.  Perhaps you can help me.  It's similar to The Next Web logo except that its letters are blue, and they're loopier.  And it runs in my mind that it's a single word split over multiple lines.  If this is ringing a bell for you, let me know in the comments.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Sketching</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mJPLW.jpg" alt="JT sketch" /></p>

<p>I'm a doodler at heart.  I really like it.  And typography art has been one of my favorites since elementary school.  So, this little project was fun and natural for me once I decided on just doing some initials.</p>

<p>In general, most of my designs are clean, modern, and minimalistic.  (At least those are the <em>good</em> words that come to mind. :)  So I was surprised when I decided I liked this design best.  After I drew it, I made a list of the things it reminded me of.  In order, they were: Tape worm, Christmas candy, measuring tape, bow on a present.  Hehe, what a logo, eh?!</p>

<h2>Illustrator</h2>

<p>I didn't have access to a scanner at the time, and my digital camera was out of juice, so I didn't make this sketch digital until later.  I just set to work in Illustrator with the pen tool.  I don't feel very comfortable in Illustrator.  I feel much more adept at Photoshop.  But, I've been determined to better myself with the Pen tool especially and learn the Illustrator environment.  Given that, I'm happy with the paths that I drew.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SqUDw.png" alt="JT paths" /></p>

<p>I only had one total restart.  This is version 2.  In planning for the gradients and just wanting to break up the path to make it easier to manage, I split the glyph into 3 separate paths.  I was just eye-balling the sketch, so it's not entirely faithful.  Most obvious, the loop on the J has a much more tight, oval loop than in the sketch.  I can't decide if I like that more or less.</p>

<h2>Final Polish</h2>

<p>With 3 separate paths, it was much easier to apply some cool-looking gradients to help give the shape some depth.  I chose yellow as the base color and orange as the shadow color.  Again, this was to match the theme.  And it is also reminiscient of a "dynaLink" logo that I did once upon a time.</p>

<p>It was a fun project.  I hope it adds a bit to the site and my other online identities (see <a href="https://twitter.com/jaketrent">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/115032056022257436849/">Google Plus</a>).</p>

<p>It's not perfect, but I wanted to ship it.  What do you like about it the most?  Or what suggestions might you have?  I'm also interested in which logos have given you the most inspiration in your work.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever showed up in the App Store looking for an app in a particular category and been overwhelmed at the number of choices present?  This is certainly the case for the drawing and art app category.  But, there is at least one art app that stands out clearly from the others: <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper">"Paper" by FiftyThree</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/M0kYA.jpg" alt="Paper brushes" /></p>

<h2>Best Brush</h2>

<p>The best feature of Paper is the one you get for free: the fountain pen.  It is easily the best brush I've used on any art app.  I've tried Sketchbook and Sketchbook Ink.  They are no where close.  It has the most beautiful tapered edges.  It responds best to speed and direction.  It comes the closest to a real fountain pen.</p>

<h2>Gestures</h2>

<p>The rewind/undo feature is invaluable when drawing.  It is immediately available by using two fingers.  You can activate it anywhere on screen.  This makes for very fast iterations on a drawing.  It's both intuitive and fun.</p>

<h2>Flair</h2>

<p>The app has a great style.  It's minimalistic and focused.  The notebook collection is fun.  The page flip is fun.  The UI is simple and powerful.  The focus remains on the drawing, where it should be.</p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>

<p>Sharing is straightforward and fast.  Exporting your drawings into your photo library is easy.  It's just as easy to share on the web.  Tweet with "#MadeWithPaper" and you'll show up on their <a href="http://madewithpaper.fiftythree.com/">blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<p>I get the fountain pen brush for free, and I'm happy.  You pay $2 to get each of their 4 other brushes.  The next coolest is definitely the water color brush.  It totally makes sense to pay for these top-notch brushes.  Each brush takes considerable time and effort to develop.  Other apps -- I'm looking at your Sketchbook -- might include a pile of brushes at a lower price, but they are simply not as good.</p>

<h2>Wish List</h2>

<p>There are a few things that I think the app is lacking:</p>

<ol>
<li>The color palette is too simple.  I would love more options.  Apparently this is in the works.  There are many interesting <a href="http://support.fiftythree.com/fiftythree/topics/colour_palette">suggestions for expanding the palette</a> made on their forum.  <strong>Update:</strong> The latest update has a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3002676/magical-tech-behind-paper-ipads-color-mixing-perfection">sweet color mixing tool</a>.</li>
<li>A zoom feature would be nice.  The difficult thing would be mapping it to an intuitive gesture, especially differentiating it from the super-awesome rewind gesture.  The resolution is high (2048x1536), but it sometimes doesn't feel very high given that detail work is hard without a zoom.</li>
<li>Being able to change background/paper options would be awesome.  At this point, all you start with is a plain, off-white background with no texture.  The app is called "Paper", afterall.  Wouldn't it be nice to have some more options here?</li>
</ol>


<p>The product features are well-thought and the FiftyThree team obviously has a design philosophy.  So, my pining for new features is patient.  I love what they have thus far.</p>

<h2>Magical</h2>

<p>Using Paper really has been one of the magical moments of using the iPad.  It gives a slick experience that gets me drawing fast.  There are masterful, well-honed tools that make my art look good.  The use of gestures makes great use of the direct input ability of the touch device.  I've enjoyed many hours using Paper, and I look forward to more products from FiftyThree.</p>

<p>What is your favorite feature of Paper?  Or of another art/drawing app?</p>
