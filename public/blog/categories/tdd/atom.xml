<p>As soon as we begin to write a test for our code, it is natural for us to think that we are doing a good thing, and often, we are.  Yet, I believe there are times that we’re writing tests when we’re hurting more than helping — and, of course, this is not on purpose.  To clarify, I’m an advocate for testing in general, and this is a short thought on how to make it better.</p>

<h2>Verify It, and Be Done</h2>

<p>One of the main goals of testing is to verify that what you have written is correct.  So, if we’ve met that goal, there’s no need to go around the track one more time and see the checkered flag again.  The second time around produces no extra glory and no extra benefit.</p>

<p>If we cover a section of code many times, it isn’t more helpful than the first time we covered it.  To verify twice isn’t to verify any better.  If the second attempt does happen to verify the same thing in an obviously better way, remove the first attempt and keep the second.</p>

<p>If it’s a variation of a certain case that you’re verifying, that’s different.  Adding new cases based on slight permutations of previous cases can be a good thing.  But covering the exact same thing provides no value.  In fact, multiple verification of code is just a type of debt.  It should be a smell in your test code that alerts you to clean things up.</p>

<h2>The Debt of Duplicate Tests</h2>

<p>If you have multiples of something, it just increases the maintenance over time.  Why would you want to update two tests instead of one?  Now that you have duplicate tests, you also have to keep them in sync.  Of course, if they cover the exact same case, if you change source code to fix the one test, the other will still be broken and be apparent and easy to fix.</p>

<p>The more tests you have, the longer your feedback loop in development or in a continuous build environment will be.  Multiply that extra wait time across your life on the project, and it has the possibility of being a non-trivial product.  Of course we need to wait for the tests that are needful and provide added value, but we shouldn’t wait needlessly.</p>

<p>Sometimes you do see duplicate tests within the same file — for instance, within the same unit.  This might happen when different developers approach the unit at different times to add tests.</p>

<p>I think it’s probably more often the case that duplicate tests are found across test classes -- meaning across the different types of tests.  For instance, a developer might write a unit test that covers a case.  Later, someone else might add an integration test that adds the same case.  Later still, someone else might add a functional test that adds the same case yet again.  All these developers are well-intentioned in adding tests.  They all need to think, communicate, investigate, and coordinate a little more to avoid the duplicate test problem.</p>

<h2>Deleting Duplicate Tests</h2>

<p>When duplicate tests are found, we should delete them.  Again, this might require some thinking.  We might want to consider which of the duplicate cases is the best test and therefore the one to keep.  This consideration might include which test is most stable, runs the fastest, is most readable, best designed, latest, earliest, etc.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Duplicate Tests</h2>

<p>The best scenario would be the one where we avoid duplicate tests.  Teams with clear guidelines will be able to coordinate better.  Useful information might include which classes of tests exist in the project and what each is intended for.  We might describe which kinds of tests we prefer, in which order, for certain kinds of verifications.  Having clean, well-organized tests will also encourage the team to read each others’ tests and familiarize themselves with what’s already written and know where to find existing cases and where to properly categorize new cases.</p>

<p>So have fun testing, and destroy the duplicate tests!  Yay for test doubles, but boo for double tests.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unit testing is a required part of a healthy software development lifecycle and a balanced breakfast.  But test-driven development is a rockin' part of an <em>awesome</em> development lifecycle.  What's the difference?  If you don't test-drive the dev of your MarkLogic XQuery, you may never come back to test again.  Test-driven XQuery development will ease your headaches, put you into the plush seat of a developer with confidence, and rocket you down the road to making all your wildest dreams come true.  Kachow!</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Ok, it may be slightly <em>more</em> magical than that.  But, I don't want to get your hopes up.  Seriously, though, if TDD is fun in, say Java Land (and it still is in MarkLogic land with "the Swede"), then it's a required portion of fun in MarkLogic Land?  Why?  While you might imagine yourself going back and adding tests to your Java project and sometimes you do, if you imagine it and then attempt it in your XQuery project, I believe the likelihood that you shrivel in shame and tears under your desk is much higher than in some other environments.</p>

<p>I the difficulty of the test after development approach is higher in MarkLogic XQuery because of what I've called "camouflaged dependencies" -- essentially, access to the http request and respond and to the database.</p>

<p>You can get access to request fields or headers or anything else dealing with the web context in which the code is executed at any place in your code.  This doesn't mean you have to code like this, but the language doesn't necessarily help you enforce your discipline.  This is where testing before you write the code will help.  Make you functions functional -- pass in parameters and make them the only data access.</p>

<p>You can read the database natively in MarkLogic XQuery.  That means that you can be retrieving data anywhere in your code.  There is an extreme lack of ceremony in making a connection to the database -- it's always there;  they're connected.  This is both refreshing and a shiny nail strip upon which to puncture the tires of your test-driven sports coupe e're you drive it off the lot.  Resist the temptation to read from the database or write to the database save in very determined and specific parts of your app -- parts that you will not actually unit test [gasp] because they'll be doing nothing but saving xmls at given database uris, and MarkLogic already has internal testing for that.</p>

<p>So, respect what you might call your dependencies -- the network and the database -- and be thrilled with the adventure of testing the business logic that you write yourself and need to verify.  And test it first to help keep you on the strait and narrow.  Otherwise, you're "discipline" will crumble under deadlines and in the end it will "just work" -- until it doesn't -- and you won't know why.</p>

<p>Note:
Below are the slides to support a presentation given at an in-house development conference.  It is an evolution of a talk previously given on <a href="">unit testing XQuery on MarkLogic</a> with streamlined principles and skills section and a not-included coding portion surrounding the use of XqTest, our XQuery unit test framework, and its integration in our environment.  Tonight, as I say my prayers, I will continue to hope that someday XqTest will be released from its prison and "the Swede" will see the light of day!</p>
