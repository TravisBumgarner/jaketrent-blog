    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Exercism.io is a fantastic site and tool that provides a wealth of daily code exercises.  If you want to learn to be better in a language, it's a great resource to do exercises and receive feedback.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Origin</h2>

<p><a href="http://exercism.io">Exercism.io</a> was introduced to me by Franklin Webber of gSchool and JumpStart Labs fame.  He and his colleagues use it as a part of their instruction, and it's a great, free tool available to the public.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p>There is a fun array of language-learning possibilities inside Exercism.  It currently includes a varying number of exercises across these languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>clojure</li>
<li>elixir</li>
<li>haskell</li>
<li>javascript</li>
<li>objective-c</li>
<li>python</li>
<li>ruby</li>
<li>scala</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm currently running through the Ruby exercises.</p>

<h2>Starting Point</h2>

<p>Based on what I've seen of the Ruby and JavaScript exercises, I don't think that Exercism's exercises are meant for an absolute beginner.  Some basic knowledge of the programming language is assumed and required.  You'll start a little deep if you know next to nothing.  These exercises are meant to expand your exposure to and understanding of language features.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Installation consists of a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://exercism.io">exercism.io</a> and register using your Github credentials.</li>
<li>While on the site, download the CLI.  It's a pre-built binary that you just need to put somewhere that is tied to your system PATH.  That way you can execute it from the terminal.</li>
<li>Setup your environment for the language you'll be learning.  Again, this information is on the site.  None of the environments are automatic in their setup, and you must follow the written steps to be ready to develop in your weapon, er language of choice.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Your First Exercise</h2>

<p>After installation, you're ready for your first exercise.  On the terminal, type:</p>

<p><code>bash
exercism fetch
</code></p>

<p>This will download fresh exercises at the head of each of your language paths.  At first, you'll start on exercise 0 of each of the language paths.  Now, choose a language.  I chose Ruby first.  The first exercise was called <code>bob</code>.  Bob is a lackadaisical teenager who responds with smart remarks to whatever somewhat says to him.  Typical.</p>

<p>Bob comes with a suite of failing tests.  All the tests are written, and it's up to use to write the code that actually makes Bob function and the tests pass.  This is literally TDD or test-driven development, and yay for us, someone has already written the tests!  In the case of Ruby, the tests are written in a MiniTest syntax.  To run them, I'm typing:</p>

<p><code>bash
ruby bob_test.rb
</code></p>

<p>This is where I think we might be able to have a bit of a better setup with the exercises.  It would be nice to have the tests automatically run on a file watch as opposed to having to run them each time manually.  For this, I personally setup <code>guard-minitest</code>.  I would recommend the same.  Of course, I can only think that Exercism doesn't do this by default in order to simplify the environment setup process.</p>

<h2>Nitpicking</h2>

<p>After you complete your first exercise in some form by getting all the tests to pass, you can submit it to the site for feedback.  For example:</p>

<p><code>bash
exercism submit ruby/bob/bob.rb
</code></p>

<p>The CLI will give you a link to your now-online code, and you can go there to see your submission.  Others who have completed the same exercise will also be able to see your solution.  And this is one of the coolest potentials of Exercism.  Others can give you feedback on your solution, called "nitpicks" by default.  This is a great learning opportunity.  We are ready to take feedback given from the perspective of others in their experience with the language.  We can also give feedback, training our eye to be more critical in our observation and future writing of code.  It feels like a great outcome and a great potential community.</p>

<p>I have given nitpicks.  Of course, that's easier to do.  But, I am sad to say that I have never received any.  It's hard to tell how active the community really is.  I see quite a few submissions, but there are definitely fewer nitpicks than submissions.  There's quite a bit untapped community learning potential here.  To help this, I wish the system allowed you to unlock the next exercise in your language path without closing opportunity for nitpicks on submitted exercises.</p>

<p>So, have you used Exercism.io before?  Do you know of similar sites?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/save-gem-to-gemfile-from-terminal/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-18T07:54:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/save-gem-to-gemfile-from-terminal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wished you could save a gem to your <code>Gemfile</code> straight from the command line?  I wish Rubygems had this built in, but it's easy to add.  After all, there's a gem for that.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/x2I31sl.jpg" alt="Gemrat" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>From npm</h2>

<p>Coming from Node/Npm previous to Ruby/Rubygems, I wished I could do something like this:</p>

<p><code>bash
npm install express --save
</code></p>

<p>This would take my specified npm module and append it to the end of my <code>package.json</code> dependencies list.</p>

<p>There is no equivalent for this built into Rubygems.</p>

<h2>Gemrat</h2>

<p>But, there is a mutant beast that skulks through the gem-lined sewers of Rubyland -- and it's name is <code>gemrat</code>!  What a great, image-provoking name.  Once you install <code>gemrat</code>, you will have the power of 20 npms at your fingertips.</p>

<p>First, install it:</p>

<p><code>bash
gem install gemrat
</code></p>

<p>Next, decide what gem you want to save to your <code>Gemfile</code>.  Let's choose a gem of a gem to try called <code>guard</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
gemrat guard
</code></p>

<p>Now, install the dependencies listed in your <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
bundle install
</code></p>

<p>Kaboom.  You have learned the secrets of the Fire Swamp and could live there for some time.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/debug-ruby-rails/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-14T07:37:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/debug-ruby-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Interactive debugging can sometimes be faster and more effective in helping you code than a <code>puts</code> statement.  It's easy to get interactive debugging in Ruby or on Rails with the help of a nice gem.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Z7WWtL0.jpg" alt="Ruby" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>No IDE Required</h2>

<p>There are Ruby IDEs that provide interactive debugging capabilities.  My favorite is <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine by Jetbrains</a>.  But if you don't have or don't want an IDE, there's still hope.</p>

<h2>Debugger Gem</h2>

<h4>Include the dependency</h4>

<p>My new buddy George showed me a sweet gem simply named <code>debugger</code>.  To use it, I first add the <code>debugger</code> dependency to my <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<p>```
source "https://rubygems.org"</p>

<p>gem 'debugger'
```</p>

<h4>Add a breakpoint</h4>

<p>Next, I need to add my "breakpoint" into my code that I'm going to run.  In this case, the breakpoint is defined by calling <code>debugger</code>.  On the same line, we'll also import the <code>debugger</code> library:</p>

<p>```ruby
  # ...
  def is_anagram?</p>

<pre><code>require 'debugger'; debugger
same_length? and different? and has_same_letters?
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<h4>Run your code</h4>

<p>In this example, I'm going to break right after I call the <code>is_anagram?</code> method.  From the terminal, now I exercise the code.  In this case, I'll run my unit tests:</p>

<p><code>bash
ruby anagram_test.rb
</code></p>

<h4>Debug like a champ</h4>

<p>And when execution of the script gets to the <code>debugger</code> line, execution will pause and output in my terminal will look something like this:</p>

<p>```ruby
/Users/jake.trent/dev/exercism/ruby/anagram/anagram.rb:13
same_length? and different? and has_same_letters?</p>

<p>[8, 17] in /Users/jake.trent/dev/exercism/ruby/anagram/anagram.rb
   8      @letters2 = @word2.split('')
   9    end
   10
   11    def is_anagram?
   12      require 'debugger'; debugger
=> 13      same_length? and different? and has_same_letters?
   14    end
   15
   16    def has_same_letters?
   17      same_letters = true
(rdb:1)
```</p>

<p>A snippet of my code is shown, an arrow points at line 13, and there's a prompt at the bottom (labeled 'rdb') that you can type in.  <code>debugger</code> gives you a few special commands to type, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>n</code> - next</li>
<li><code>s</code> - step over</li>
<li><code>c</code> - continue</li>
</ul>


<p>These commands should be familiar to almost all debuggers.  The other fabulous thing is that the prompt functions as a sort of <code>irb</code> session from the current context of your code.  So, I can type variable names to see their contents or call functions to see what they'd return.  So, in the case of this code, I could try:</p>

<p><code>bash
(rdb:1) has_same_letters?
true
(rdb:1) @letters2
["s", "t", "a", "n", "d"]
</code></p>

<p>Pretty cool and pretty powerful all for the price of including the library and including a breakpoint in your code.</p>

<p>Are there tools similar to this that you love to use for debugging?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/import-erb-into-karma/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-20T16:59:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/import-erb-into-karma</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rails asset pipeline allows you to use erb helpers in your CoffeeScript.  You'll still need to bring get these files into Karma runner.  It's really easy.  You just need to get to know your Karma config options.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/i5fJT6j.png" alt="erb files in Karma runner" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>erb in JavaScripts</h2>

<p>Why in the world would you want to use erb helpers inside your script files?  You might not.  I definitely think this should be a limited practice.  In some cases, it can be very helpful.  For instance, if you use Ruby/Rails (via <a href="https://github.com/rumblelabs/asset_sync"><code>asset_sync</code></a>) to upload your static assets to an external server, such as S3, you can help your scripts know where static assets live after upload.</p>

<p>So your script might use the <code>asset_path</code> helper and end up looking something like this:</p>

<p>```coffeescript app.coffee.erb
angular.module('app', []).config ($routeProvider) -></p>

<p>  $routeProvider</p>

<pre><code>.when '/admin',
  controller: 'AdminIndexCtrl'
  templateUrl: "&lt;%= asset_path('admin/index.html') %&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Import erb Files into Karma</h2>

<p>Well, now you have an <code>app.coffee.erb</code> file.  You need to get it into <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io">Karma runner</a>.  Normally <code>*.coffee</code> files will be brought straight in and compiled automatically by the runner as needed.  In this case, however, the Karma defaults won't recognize the <code>.coffee.erb</code> file as a CoffeeScript file need compilation.</p>

<p>To tell Karma to process your erb file as a CoffeeScript file, add this to your config:</p>

<p>```coffeescript karma.conf.coffee
module.exports = (config) ->
  config.set</p>

<pre><code># ...
preprocessors:
  '**/*.coffee.erb': ['coffee']
  '**/*.coffee': ['coffee']
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>That's it.  That's the key to getting your Erb files processed into JavaScript and ready for Karma to use.</p>

<p>Now, what are your thoughts on putting your CoffeeScripts through the erb filter of the asset pipeline at all?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Xip.io is a DNS wildcard domain that was initially created for use on Ruby projects.  But its application is desirable across platforms.  Recently, I wanted to use Xip.io on a NodeJs project.  It was easy to make happen.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PJTnZmM.jpg" alt="xip.io" /></p>

<h2>Update: Proxying is Built Into Pow</h2>

<p>After having a handful of problems with these home-grown proxies, my search eventually led me to know that Pow 0.4.0+ includes proxying as a built-in feature.  So, you don't need your own <code>config.ru</code> any more.  Once you install pow, choose the port that your app will run on and at what pow address you want to access your app, and run one command in your terminal:</p>

<p><code>
echo 3000 &gt; ~/.pow/myapp
</code></p>

<p>Then you'll access your app, running in the background on port 3000 via the web browser at <code>http://myapp.dev</code>.  Way better.  Skip the rest of this article.</p>

<h2>Install Pow and Powder</h2>

<p>Pow is a development server that uses Xip.io.  Powder is a cli that makes working with Pow even easier.  To start, make sure that <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a> is setup with <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems</a> in your environment.  Then install Pow.  They have a short little install script you can run, as <a href="http://pow.cx/">referenced on the Pow site</a>.</p>

<p>Then install Powder:</p>

<p><code>
gem install powder
</code></p>

<h2>Proxy your NodeJs app</h2>

<p>Pow only knows how to handle Rack apps, so we have to create one to be loaded into Pow.  Since we're writing the guts of our app on another platform -- in this case, Node -- we'll just create a proxy Rack app.</p>

<p>I found a bit of <a href="https://github.com/linjunpop/node-with-pow">proxy app code</a>, which you should save in your project root as <code>config.ru</code>, and which I paste here:</p>

<p>The only change you might have to make is the port number for your app (line 13).  In this case, I'm using port 3000 for my NodeJs app.</p>

<h2>Link Your App</h2>

<p>Now all we have to do is link our app to Pow.  Powder helps us do this easily.  Go to your project root directory and type:</p>

<p><code>
powder link &lt;project_name&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Now run your app with whatever command starts NodeJs.  It's probably something like this:</p>

<p><code>
node app.js
</code></p>

<p>Now you should be able to access your app via your web browser at <code>http://&lt;project_name&gt;.dev</code>.  One of the great things about Xip.io is that it makes running your local app <a href="http://jaketrent.com/post/run-pow-server-on-vm/">extremely easy from a local Virtual machine</a> as well.  To get the address of your app to use in your VM, type this from your native terminal:</p>

<p><code>
powder open --xip
</code></p>

<p>And copy the resulting URL into your VM web browser.</p>

<p>Ah, the fusion of Node and Ruby is pretty sweet.</p>
