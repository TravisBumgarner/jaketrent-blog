    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you'll want to use <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a> to install a package that doesn't exist in the official npm registry for some reason.  Maybe you're developing the package yourself.  Maybe it's an internal use-only package. Maybe the package writer never published it.  Here are a few ways to install a local package with npm.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xnDMm.jpg" alt="Node Package Manager" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Link the Local Node Package</h2>

<p>If you're developing a package locally, you're likely making lots of changes to the source.  You don't want to publish after each change in order to install this package as a dependency elsewhere.  Npm has provided the <a href="http://npmjs.org/doc/link.html">link</a> keyword.</p>

<p>This allows your put a global label on your package that tells your local npm cache about it:</p>

<p><code>bash
cd &lt;pkg_dir&gt;;
npm link;
</code></p>

<p>And then go to the local project that you're using the package in and point to the dependency by package name:</p>

<p><code>bash
cd &lt;project_dir&gt;;
npm link &lt;pkg_name&gt;;
</code></p>

<p>Now you have symlinked a directory called <code>&lt;pkg_name&gt;</code> in the project's node_modules directory.  Changes you make in your package will appear and be usable from within your project.</p>

<h2>Tarball the Local Node Package</h2>

<p>Npm can <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/install.html">install</a> either a path or url to a local tarball.  To create a tarball that npm will like, you want to run npm <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/pack.html">pack</a>:</p>

<p><code>bash
cd &lt;pkg_dir&gt;;
npm pack
</code>
This will create a tarball a la <code>&lt;pkg_name&gt;-&lt;pkg_ver&gt;.tgz</code>.  Now just store your new tarball somewhere like a local filesystem or server that is accessible when you run npm install on your dependant project.</p>

<p>You can ask for the tarball manually:</p>

<p><code>bash
npm install http://localServer/my-pkg-0.0.1.tgz
</code></p>

<p>Or put the reference in your package.json for later:</p>

<p>```js
{
  "dependencies": {</p>

<pre><code>"my-pkg": "http://localServer/my-pkg-0.0.1.tgz"
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>You probably have a node package that's only available locally for a reason.  To guarantee that it's not accidentally published to the world via the npm registry, add this beaut to your package.json:</p>

<p><code>js
{
   "private": true
}
</code></p>

<h2>Replicate the Npm Registry</h2>

<p>If you're going all out, like creating a corporate npm registry, you always have the option of <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/registry.html#Can-I-run-my-own-private-registry">replicating</a> the Npm registry internally.  It's CouchDb, and '<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120029/quotes?qt=qt0192627">replication</a>' is its Chinese neighbor's middle name.  You can publish your own packages there so they're still private to your and your organization.  And you also get local references to the public packages.</p>

<h2>The Glory of Npm</h2>

<p>Npm is great.  The ability to install published or local packages is an example of its flexibility and usefulness.  What are the other ways that you've found to make non-public packages installable -- for instance, that package that the writer just never bothered to publish to npm?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/impressions-of-grunt/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-12T14:24:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/impressions-of-grunt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Grunt is a great build tool for JavaScript projects.  It comes with a lot out of the box, and you can write your own custom tasks.  It joins a world fraught with many, glorious build tool options.  So, a bit has been made of the decision to have Grunt join the fray.  Perhaps most prominently, Miller Medeiros had <a href="http://blog.millermedeiros.com/node-js-ant-grunt-and-other-build-tools/">a few problems with Grunt</a>.  And in response, Ben Alman gave his reasoning on <a href="http://benalman.com/news/2012/08/why-grunt/">why he wrote it</a>.  Having used it for a bit, I have a few impressions.  Here they are so far.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4773D.jpg" alt="Grunt impressions" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Community</h2>

<p>There will probably never be any build tool that gains more mass than what already exists as just a bash or a make script.  And really nothing needs to.  Healthy-sized communities have been built up around different build tool options where those that used it liked the style, it fit their platform, and they found it useful.  Grunt feels like it's on track to become a highlight build tool in the Js community.  There are many using it <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/issues/9">already</a> and more <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/1544">on the way</a>.</p>

<h2>Declarative vs. Procedural</h2>

<p>Which style of project configuration is better?  Declarative or procedural?  Wars have been started with lesser words.  I don't feel like it's a question of better.  It's just a matter of style.  There are pros and cons.  Where you do the many of same things as everyone else, declarative works just fine.  When you have to do new, original things, you have to write code to support that.  You might wrap that in a grunt plugin to encapsulate it then write declarative options to feed it.  But, you still own the plugin implementation.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Build for JavaScript Project</h2>

<p>Maybe obviously, the sweet spot for Grunt is building JavaScript projects.  Js projects are becoming more complex all the time.  Often, complementary build tools are lacking.  There are other projects that are named <a href="https://github.com/280north/jake">awesomely</a>, though they are mostly dead.  Grunt fills a gap for JavaScript projects.  It seems that the advantages of writing client <em>and</em> server js apply here as well:  Js build tools take advantage of the Js (Node) environment.  You can use your Js skills here.  The context switching is diminished.</p>

<h2>Synchronous Exec for JavaScript Build</h2>

<p>One of the main sellings points for NodeJs is that it is built from the ground up for using in asychronous environments and problems.  Build scripts aren't generally asynchronous.  Usually, it's quite the opposite.  Step 1 leads to step 2 and so on.  You can't skip, and future steps rely upon completion of the previous.</p>

<p>So, you can try <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback">child_process.exec</a>, but it's asynchronous.  So, make it synchronous and try <a href="https://github.com/jeremyfa/node-exec-sync">exec-sync</a>.  But it has <a href="https://github.com/jeremyfa/node-exec-sync/issues/8">problems</a> vanilla exec doesn't.  The best synchronous exec for JavaScript I've found so far is <a href="http://documentup.com/arturadib/shelljs#command-reference/exec-command-options-callback">shelljs.exec</a>.</p>

<p>In this way, NodeJs/Grunt seems like an awkward fit as a build tool.</p>

<h2>Shell Commands in Grunt</h2>

<p>When I end up doing custom things in my Grunt build, it tends to be that I'm trying to get to the shell and execute something.  If I have a shell script, I can just execute it with <a href="https://github.com/jharding/grunt-exec">grunt-exec</a>.  If I'm trying to keep all logic in Grunt, I'll use <a href="https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs">shelljs</a>.  The thing that gets me with both of these solutions is that I'm in Node, constantly trying to get out of Node to run something in the shell, like a git command.  So my code ends up looking like lots of these:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">shell</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;shelljs&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">grunt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">writeln</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Cloning repo&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">shell</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">exec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;git clone &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">opts</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">repo</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>There's a bit of cruft to recreate bash in Node.  It's not as clean and does not read as well as a vanilla shell script might:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Cloning repo&#39;</span>;
</span><span class='line'>git clone <span class="nv">$repo</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<h2>New APIs</h2>

<p>Grunt does quite a bit for you.  It's now up to me to go figure out all the cool stuff it can do.  Once I found the <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/grunt.file">file API</a>, I was excited and retained a touch of the nagging feeling I just mentioned related to shell commands.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Build Scripts are Cross-OS Compatible</h2>

<p>One of the main reasons you would choose to write JavaScript for a build script instead of a .sh or a .bat file is that you can use it multiple OS'es.  Node <a href="https://github.com/jeremyfa/node-exec-sync/pull/6">should</a> :) execute the same on each platform it supports -- essentially Windows, Linux, and Osx.</p>

<h2>Builds Scripts as Plugins</h2>

<p>When you come up with a new Grunt task that is obviously useful for someone else out in the world, you'll likely generalize it and publish it to npm.  There already a good number of <a href="https://npmjs.org/browse/keyword/gruntplugin">'gruntplugin'</a>s out there.  This is a great sharing mechanism that not every build tool environment will give you.  I'm grateful for the good Grunt plugins shared out there.</p>

<h2>Grunt Configuration</h2>

<p>Grunt, by default, has a declarative configuration style.  This means lots of json, often long and nested.  It's all organized by task names, so it's fairly easy to find stuff.  But the bottom line is that there is a fair bit to navigate in the average grunt file.</p>

<h2>Breaking Changes in Grunt API</h2>

<p>As of this writing, Grunt 0.4 is on the verge of release.  By all accounts it will make things better, and it looks promising.  They have a mostly-straightforward <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Upgrading-from-0.3-to-0.4">migration guide</a>.  The thing that has been the most painful is the lack of backward compatibility.  My current, working builds rely on Grunt plugins that are not 0.4 compliant, so I have two choices:  Help each of those plugins upgrade or wait until 0.4 reaches critical mass -- ie, most worthy plugins are upgraded.</p>

<h2>Grunt is Fast</h2>

<p>Grunt is faster than Pumba being chased by a hyena.  Previous to Grunt, we were using Maven to do similar tasks.  Now we do more (Grunt has made it easy for us to incorporate more good practices -- eg, linting), and the build is done is a serious fraction of the time.  The speed is super dependant on what operations the build actually performs, but my impression for my builds is that Grunt is fast.</p>

<h2>The Grunt Logo</h2>

<p>Yes, it's superficial, and it's even a lame reason, but I like Grunt because they have a great logo.  Wild boar for logo?  Instant win.  (That is what it is, right?)</p>

<p>So, is Grunt helping you out?  What are your impressions?  Or are you using something else entirely?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/requirejs-paths-in-prod-test-build/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-07T11:18:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/requirejs-paths-in-prod-test-build</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>RequireJs makes dependency management on the client mostly better.  Once it's setup, it's nice.  Getting the patterns of your paths to work correctly can be difficult to setup, depending on the constraints of your system.  Making the same paths work in a prod, test, and build environment can be even more adventuresome.  In my case, there were a few extra hoops.  My scenario might not fully match yours, but perhaps you can apply this solution to your own needs.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xZqm5.png" alt="Alt Text" /></p>

<h2>Prod: Loading Modules From a Different Server</h2>

<p>Recently, we built a portal.  It contains a bunch of widgets that are served from domains different from the host page.  The portal requested these widget js files via <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJs</a>.</p>

<p>Because the widgets live on other domains, those widgets' subdependencies needed a path that would be relative to that other widget domain and not the portal domain.  In order to accomplish this, widget dependencies were specified in this way:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">define</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s1">&#39;./widgetDependency.js&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">dep</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">// my widget code</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The <code>.js</code> extension tells RequireJs to load the dependency <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/2.1.1/require.js#L1521">as a URL</a>.  The <code>./</code> makes the URL relative to the widget domain.</p>

<h2>Test: RequireJs Paths in Testacular</h2>

<p>When you go to test your modules in a test environment, you may not want to load your modules as URLs.  Such was the case for me, <a href="http://jaketrent.com/post/test-requirejs-testacular/">running Testacular</a>, where the source code is requested into the context of the test server already.</p>

<p>In prod, I needed the <code>.js</code> extension.  But, in test I didn't want to load modules from URLs.  So, I need to make the test environment ignore the extension.  The solution?  Override the regular expression that checks for the extension in my test runner to be something that was never matched:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">jsExtRegExp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sr">/&lt;sup&gt;pileOTest/</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/sup&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This allows RequireJs to load the module by module name.</p>

<h4>RequireJs Adds Double .js Extension</h4>

<p>It's getting better in the test environment, but we still haven't totally appeased RequireJs.  It turns out that when it loads a module by name, it still has to <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/2.1.1/require.js#L1526">convert that name to a path</a>.</p>

<p>Given my constraints (widgets from another domain on a portal), my name actually includes a <code>.js</code> extension.  This isn't usually the case.  RequireJs doesn't test for this again (remember, we overrode the regex that did), so it just adds a <code>.js</code> extension on the end, creating two: <code>.js.js</code>.</p>

<p>But there is one final way to trick it out:  Add a '?' to the name.  This rule was meant to apply to URLs that represented dynamic scripts (and would thus take query strings) as opposed to static js files.  That's not why we'll add it, but it will help us nonetheless.</p>

<p>So now your module dependencies will look like this:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">define</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s1">&#39;./widgetDependency.js?&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">dep</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">// my widget code</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And in your test environment they will load, and you will be happy.  Until...</p>

<h2>Build: Module Names for Optimization</h2>

<p>When you go to <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#basics">optimize your RequireJs modules</a> you'll again need RequireJs to load your modules by module name instead of url.  If you don't, you'll get nice messages like:</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>Tracing dependencies for: MyModule
Cannot optimize network URL, skipping: nls/str.js?
Error: ENOENT, no such file or directory
'/Users/.../style.css?'
In module tree:</p>

<pre><code>MyModule
</code></pre>

<p>```</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>You may cry a little, but we're almost there.  Remember, your module dependency paths worked just fine in prod.  You only changed them to accommodate the test environment.  So, it's time to change them back when you optimize your module into one file for production use.</p>

<p>The <code>r.js</code> configuration in <code>app.build.js</code> includes an function called <code>onBuildRead()</code>'.  Call it to transform the code as it goes out the door for optimization.  We want to strip out the '?' question marks from our dependency arrays.  Stripping out all '?'s might be a bit too dangerous.  So, let's make a benign adjustment that will help us identify exactly what we're trying to strip out and replace our '?' string in our dependency paths with '?test', finally:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">define</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s1">&#39;./widgetDependency.js?test&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">dep</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">// my widget code</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/2.1.1/build/example.build.js#L417">implement <code>onBuildRead</code></a> as:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">onBuildRead</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">moduleName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">contents</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">br</span><span class="o">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">contents</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\?test/g</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<h4>"Shut off all the garbage smashers on the detention level!"</h4>

<p>Take a deep breath.  That was a little much to make all that work.  You have made your RequireJs paths happy in 3 contexts:</p>

<ol>
<li>In production, where modules are served from domains different from the host page and must be loaded by URL.</li>
<li>In test, where your modules must be loaded by module name.</li>
<li>In the optimization build, where modules must be loaded by module name.</li>
</ol>


<p>I fill like I've tricked out RequireJs a bit to make this work.  How could we adjust the solution to be more straightforward?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/environment-variables-in-node/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-05T16:12:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/environment-variables-in-node</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes things change in different environments.  For one, I wear a tie to church but try not to otherwise.  In Node, you might want variables to change per environment.  And it turns out people have wanted this exact thing, creating marvels of code for us to use as we please.  Enter, nconf.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5rZ8H.png" alt="Environment variables in Node" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Nconf</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flatiron/nconf">Nconf</a> provides "hierarchical node.js configuration with files, environment variables, command-line arguments, and atomic object merging."  It is a great little package provided by the folks at <a href="http://nodejitsu.com/">NodeJitsu</a>.</p>

<p>To install, run a little:</p>

<p><code>
$ npm install nconf
</code></p>

<h4>Environment Variables in Node</h4>

<p>Often, NodeJs environments are specified through the aptly-named environment variables.  These are the variables that are set on a system level, available to yours and other applications.  In Unixy environments, you'd set one with:</p>

<p><code>
$ export NODE_ENV=production
</code></p>

<p>And it turns out that <code>NODE_ENV</code> is the single most-used environment variable of them all.  Really, it's the big kahuna that triggers other environment variables or code for activation.</p>

<p>For instance, in an <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> app, you'll see this a lot:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;production&#39;</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;env&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;dbUri&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;n.n.n.n/prod&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Actually, you see <a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.configure"><code>configure()</code></a>, but it's all just sugar around a check to <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code>.</p>

<h4>Set NODE_ENV and Start Node</h4>

<p>If you want to start node and set the environment variable all in a one liner, try:</p>

<p><code>
$ export NODE_ENV=production &amp;&amp; node app.js
</code></p>

<h4>Multiple, Variable Sources</h4>

<p>You could just grab all your variables out the process environment, but the cool thing that nconf gives you is a hierarchy.  The <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/nconf">docs</a> give the probable example of the following hierarchy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Command-line arguments</li>
<li>Environment variables</li>
<li>A file</li>
</ol>


<p>One could access these sources in code with this beaut:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">nconf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;nconf&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">nconf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">argv</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">code</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">file</span><span class="o">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="s1">&#39;config.json&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>You could even have a config file specific to each environment that ships with your app and load it with a slightly spiffier:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">nconf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;nconf&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">nconf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">argv</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">code</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">file</span><span class="o">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="nx">process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">NODE_ENV</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;.json&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<h4>Using the Data</h4>

<p>Finally, after loading, just access your environment variables and incorporate them in your code as you will:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">nconf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;NODE_ENV&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Declare some variables per environment.  Likely candidates are database connection strings or web service endpoints or feature flags.  These will help you avoid as many nasty if-else branches in your code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it may be useful to know how many attributes a JavaScript object has.  There's not a fantastic way to do this.  Or maybe there is.  Do you know one?  Could cut out IE8 support.  Or, for what it's worth, here's a way.</p>

<h2>Which Objects have a Length</h2>

<p>If instantiate a new object, it does <em>not</em> have a built-in length attribute:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">blockquote</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kc">undefined</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kc">undefined</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p></blockquote>

<p>If I add an arbitrary property that object, it still doesn't affect the length:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">blockquote</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">prop1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;adsf&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">&#39;adsf&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kc">undefined</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p></blockquote>

<p>If I instantiate a new array, it has a built-in length attribute:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">blockquote</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kc">undefined</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">arr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">arr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">2</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">arr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">2</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p></blockquote>

<p>But an array is an object whose attributes are numbers, right?  So, if I put an arbitrary property on it, does it affect length:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">blockquote</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">arr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">prop1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;asdf&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">&#39;asdf&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">arr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">2</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p></blockquote>

<p>No, this <code>arr</code> array still just has the two items we previously pushed onto it.</p>

<h2>Just Iterating</h2>

<p>So, how do you find out how many attributes are in an object (not array)?  Just iterate on it:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">numAttrs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">key</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">code</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hasOwnProperty</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">key</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">++</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>I found this a bit painful to write.  There should be a better way, right?  Do you know what it is?</p>

<h2>A Better Way for Better Browsers</h2>

<p>If your in a <a href="http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/">Modern JavaScript environment</a>, give this a whirl:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">Object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">keys</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">length</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Way nicer.  Don't try in &lt;= IE8.</p>
