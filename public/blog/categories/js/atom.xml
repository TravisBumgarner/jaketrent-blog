    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are simple mechanisms for passing data from your web page to AngularJs.  One directive is called <code>ngInit</code>.  You may well need it.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wVBKD.png" alt="Angular data passing" /></p>

<h2>The Use Cases</h2>

<p>The use cases don't make a ton of sense without a concrete example.  There are several ways to implement even the most simple example.  If the solution doesn't seem to fit the problem, try another way.</p>

<p>For our purposes, let's say that we're displaying a list of comments on the screen.</p>

<h4>Angular Requests Data</h4>

<p>It's easy to put data into scope for AngularJs to use if Angular is the one to request the data initially.  This often will look something like this:</p>

<p>```coffeescript
$http.get('/comments')
  .success((comments) -></p>

<pre><code>$scope.comments = comments
</code></pre>

<p>  )
```</p>

<p>Then your template will automatically have the data in scope.  And the template (<a href="http://slim-lang.org">Slim</a> syntax used below) can look like this:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">h1</span> <span class="no">Comments</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">ul</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">li</span> <span class="n">ng</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">repeat</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;comment in comments&quot;</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;| {{ comment }}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now when we add a new comment via Ajax, we can push it right into the comment collection, and the page is updated by Angular with the appropriate data.  Or if we want to perform an operation on a pre-existing comment, it's easy to do via an AJAX operation and display the result.</p>

<h4>Server Renders Data Initially</h4>

<p>Sometimes it'll make sense for the server to render the data.  Often this kind of data will be the main content on the page.  When the client receives the page, we want the data display to be immediate.  We don't want them to load a page with a spinner for the main content, then wait and watch it spin while the real content is requested secondarily.</p>

<p>If the server was to initially print the comments, like so:</p>

<p>```ruby
h1 Comments
ul
  - for comment in comments</p>

<pre><code>li 
  = comment
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>We still might want to do AJAX'y things with a comment, such as like it.  When I like it, I don't want the browser to have to refresh, so I want to make Angular do this for me.</p>

<h2>ngInit Passes Angular Server Data</h2>

<p>Angular provides a nice directive, <code>ngInit</code> for passing Angular data.  It's a mechanism by which you can bootstrap your scripts with the data they need to function.  A mixture of server rendering and client-side AJAX requests on the same data will probably mean that you're going to use this directive.</p>

<p>From the <code>ngInit</code> docs:</p>

<blockquote><p> The ngInit directive specifies initialization tasks to be executed before the template enters execution mode during bootstrap.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our server/client mixture code might look something like this:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">h1</span> <span class="no">Comments</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">ul</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">comment</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">comments</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;li ng-init=&quot;commentLikeCount[i]=</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">comment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">likeCount</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sr">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  = comment</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  | Likes for this comment: {{commentLikeCount[i]}}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  a ng-click=&quot;like(commentLikeCount[i])&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>It's important to realize where data is coming from in this example.  The syntax <code>=</code> as in <code>= comment</code> and <code>#{}</code> as in <code>#{comment.likeCount}</code> are server-rendered bits.  As you know, the curlies and the ng attribute syntax is for Angular's client side rendering.</p>

<p>So how has this mixture bought us anything?</p>

<ol>
<li>The server renders the comments initially.  This makes the display immediate when the browser loads the page.</li>
<li>We init the value of <code>commentLikeCount</code>, making it available for Angular to display once the client compiles the template.</li>
<li>Since Angular has a count of the likes, it can easily update it and redisplay without a page reload after calling <code>like()</code> to increment the count.</li>
</ol>


<p>Frankly, the mixture feels a little bit odd to me.  I've seen it work.  I know there are different ways to get this done.  I think there are probably better ways.  What has worked well for you in similar use cases?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/angularjs-find-element-in-context/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-21T17:35:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/angularjs-find-element-in-context</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finding an element in context means that I can select a node from the dom within a certain range -- specifically either a node or any of its children nodes.  Is there an "Angular way" to do this?</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wVBKD.png" alt="AngularJs find in context" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Angular's Element() API</h2>

<p>Angular provides jqLite for doing basic CSS selections.  As far as I can tell, it does not give you the ability to specify a context node.  Sure, you can specify a more specific selector, but you can't pass a context programmatically.  The best you could do would look something like:</p>

<p><code>js
angular.element('.my-preknown-context .element-to-find')
</code></p>

<p>If that's sufficient for your use case, this would be the most "Angular way" to make an element selection.</p>

<h2>jQuery's API</h2>

<p>If you need to make CSS selections within a given context, you'll need to use jQuery.  jQuery's selector will be used in place of jqLite if it is loaded previous to the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event firing.  In other words, import jQuery in the <code>head</code> tag.</p>

<p>With jQuery, you can do things like this:</p>

<p><code>js
$('.element-to-find', $('.my-preknown-context'))
</code></p>

<p>But we could already do that with the above <code>angular.element</code> function.  If a constraint of our use case is that we don't yet know the selector of the context, then we need to  use this same jQuery API to do what we couldn't before.  For instance, if we want to find a child element of an element that was clicked, the inside of the click handler might look like this:</p>

<p><code>js
$('.element-to-find', $(event.currentTarget))
</code></p>

<p>We could also write it like this:</p>

<p><code>js
$(event.currentTarget).find('.element-to-find')
</code></p>

<p>Well, why not use <code>angular.element().find()</code>?  Because it is limited to querying children by tagName only.  Oh boy.  That's not all that useful.  Interesting/weird constraint.  Oh well, maybe someday.</p>

<h2>jQuery, Meet Angular</h2>

<p>So, using full jQuery is probably not the most "Angular way".  So, what's the best you can do?  Use Angular to get the context reference.  In a click handler, use the <code>$event</code> service which references the event object:</p>

<p><code>js
$('.element-to-find', $event.currentTarget)
</code></p>

<p>In a controller, use the <code>$element</code> service which references the dom node the controller is attached to:</p>

<p><code>js
$('.element-to-find', $element)
</code></p>

<p>This method uses jQuery to fill in for something it seems Angular can't do yet.  And it uses Angular where possible, since it has access to these dom references already.</p>

<p>What do you think?  Is there a more "Angular way" to do this?</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/smashing-node-review/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-29T16:51:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/smashing-node-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Node.js is everywhere.  There's a lot of room foro people to learn and get into it.  A good starter book is <a href="http://amzn.to/14ttetp">Smashing Node by Guillermo Rauch</a>.  Here's what I thought and what I learned while reading it.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hQTBeAF.jpg" alt="Smashing Node" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Overall, I would call Smashing Node an introduction to Node book.  This is a good thing.  It does a nice job of building on itself.  It starts with the JavaScript that everyone knows and advances to the new places that Node allows you to go.  The chapters are incremental.</p>

<p>It's a good length.  This is not a tome that you might pick up in a level 3 dungeon in order to boost your fire magic.  You can read a couple chapters a day and be done in a week.  Thankfully, it's in consumable-sized bits.  Maybe you'll end up boosting your fire magic a bit too.</p>

<p>The book boasts a fair breadth of subjects.  It introduces purely syntax subjects.  It also expands into working examples dealing with real network protocols and database apis.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>

<p>Guirremo has a very easy-to-read, conversational style.  I value this more and more in books -- perhaps even especially in technical books.  It helps me engage.  It helps me read faster and more.  I can read API docs when I need them.  A book should not read like an API doc.</p>

<p>Most subjects in the book were chosen well.  I enjoyed almost all of them.  There always is a bottom of the list, however, and mine ended with the MySQL, HTTP, and TCP chapters.  Knowledge on those subjects is probably good to have, but I had to slog through these chapters.</p>

<p>The code examples were enjoyable because they eventually turned into functional prototypes.  We built a Twitter client, an IRC chat, a social DJ program, and more.  That's pretty cool.  The downside was that the code examples could get a little long.  And with the entire working example, complete with all the npm commands and boilerplate code, sometimes the meaningful bits got a little obscured.  I read the book as a <a href="http://amzn.to/14ttetp">Kindle book</a> on a phone, so the long code snippets probably seemed even longer than they were.</p>

<h2>Highlight Subjects</h2>

<h4>Express Features</h4>

<p>I use <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> more than any other library in Node.  It's a great HTTP request/response wrapper that makes creating web servers fun and easy.  Even so, this book introduced a number of features of the library that I was previously unaware of.  Generally, I think it helped illuminate for me a lot of the bits of Connect, which functions underneath Express.  Specifically, did you know that you can modify the Express logger to log specific request tokens of your choosing?</p>

<h4>Redis</h4>

<p>There was a great section that took a look at <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">Mongo</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, and <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>.  I enjoyed the chapter on Redis the most.  This is probaby somewhat because I have the most to learn in Redis and have used it the least.  I was also impressed at the ease with which Guirremo layed out a simple social graph using the Redis API.  The chosen tools, Node and Redis, made it simple, short, and elegant.</p>

<p>Try writing many of the code examples in this book in Java and printing them on dead trees.  You'll need a bigger backpack.</p>

<h4>Testing</h4>

<p>I enjoyed the fact that testing was even mentioned.  A few testing styles and frameworks were introduced.  It was enjoyable but very light.  It would be cool to see a more thorough treatment, perhaps with applicable tests worked into the examples throughout the book.</p>

<p>In this same vein, I think the book did an ok job at addressing the subject of error handling.  I think this book and other Node resources and educators should focus more on this issue.  It is, after all, more important in Node's single-threaded environment than on most platforms.</p>

<h4>Web Sockets</h4>

<p>I had only previously done web sockets via <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a>, a web socket wrapper written by the author of the book.  It was good to see vanilla web sockets in action so I could better understand the technology, its limitations, and be grateful for the great libraries that help it be more useful and easy to use.</p>

<h4>Great Libraries</h4>

<p>The booked worked in usages of some great libraries throughout the coding examples.  As mentioned, <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a> is a great web socket wrapper.  <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent">Superagent</a> is a great higher-level request API.  <a href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a> is a fantastic test framework.  And <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> provides a nice model layer on top of the native MongoDb calls.</p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for?  Go learn Node!  Use this book to help you.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/how-to-make-pinterest-webservice/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-18T07:06:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/how-to-make-pinterest-webservice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pinterest currently does not have an official webservice API.  It seems kind of crazy in this day and age.  They really should have one.  I can't think what the business reasons might be for not having one.</p>

<p>They've not had one for long enough that it's high time we write our own.  It'll be surprisingly easy with a few choice tools</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7cv9d.png" alt="Pinterest API" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Webservice API on NodeJs</h2>

<p><a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJs</a> is just a fun platform to write IO-heavy applications for the web.  We're going to write a quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> endpoint using the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> library that allows us to consume real Pinterest content that's not available via a pre-existing service.</p>

<h4>Screen Scrape Pinterest</h4>

<p>Given no API, we're left to our own devices.  The data for Pinterest is only exposed via the UI on the website.  We're going to have our service visit that UI and grab the data that we need as a user of a web browser would see it.  This is screen scraping.  There a lot of downsides here, but we wouldn't be trying it if there was an API already.</p>

<p>One down side is that our service will be brittle.  If Pinterest ever changes the layout of the page, our service won't be able to bring back the right data.  Our solution will be simple, so it'll be easy to update, but this should be a red flag not to do anything mission critical via screen scraping unless you're giving it your full attention.</p>

<p>Another down side might be speed.  Screen scraping a UI is not the fastest way to get data.  We'll try and help mitigate this with the fastest tools that we have.  NodeJs is a blasted fast web server.  A library called <a href="https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio">cheerio</a> is supposedly best-in-class for screen scraping (advertised as 8x faster than <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a>).</p>

<h4>Caching</h4>

<p>To make this retrieval even faster for repeat use, caching could be very helpful.  We could cache in our service what we get back from pinterest via some datastore or we could cache in our client.  Best practices here will be very dependent on your use case.  These kind of enhancements have been made over and over again and would only clutter the simple Pinterest interaction, so I will exclude them for now.</p>

<h2>Getting Pinterest Data</h2>

<p>Here's the final solution in all its glory.  This snippet only includes only the code inside the Express route.</p>

<p>When I wrote it out for my own use, I was surprised at the brevity.  I love it.  Given, there's no handling of any errors or attempts to make this semi-robust.  This just gets us the data on a good day.</p>

<p>The final json that's exposed at our chosen Express endpoint looks like it this:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>It's ready for use by a json-ready client.  So stinkin easy.  We're connecting the web together, and it's awesome!  Now the world will know of the baked goods and flower arrangements that we love the most.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In JavaScript, functions can be defined and used in the same statement.  This makes creation quick, and the functions are considered anonymous because of their inline use and lack of assignment to a local variable.  But, there are a couple reasons you might want to label them.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uH7E2.jpg" alt="JavaScript Anonymous Functions" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Readability</h2>

<p>A great thing about functions in general is that they will tell you what they're used for.  If I call a function called <code>calculatePi()</code>, I expect it to do just that.  It's a great abstraction.  We can look at the name of the function without having to learn exactly how it does its stated task.</p>

<p>The performance of anonymous functions can often be determined from the calling context, but why not just name it for what it does like all other functions?  Did you know that you can?  Piece of pi.  Where you would normally write this:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">doStuff</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;reporting…&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Additionally label your callback:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">doStuff</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">reportResults</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;reporting…&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<h2>Easier Stack Traces</h2>

<p>To make this code actually run, let's add a little bit and stick in a thrown error that should provide us a stack trace:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">doStuff</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">doStuff</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">reportResults</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">code</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;problem&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Another difference between labeled and non-labeled anonymous functions is what they print in a stack trace. Without a label, you are getting line numbers, but the stack trace itself is harder to follow without bring up the source in order to interpret it.</p>

<p>Without named function:</p>

<p>Notice that every frame of the stack is now clearly displaying its name.</p>

<p>And wouldn't this be awesome if everyone did this, including all the people that wrote some of those favorite libraries that you use but that you have occassion to debug through?</p>

<p>What other benefits do you see that might come from naming your anonymous functions?</p>
