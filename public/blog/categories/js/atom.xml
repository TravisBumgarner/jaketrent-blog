<h2>The Schedule</h2>

<p>The conference covered a single day.  Keynote in the morning by Tom Dale, co-creator of Emberjs.  3 tracks thereafter with 5 talks each.  There was a specialized track, all focused on Angular, which was nice for anyone that wanted to focus on that framework.  There was less Node focus overall compared to last year, which was disappointing.  There were 3 talks focused on testing.  We need more good testing talks.</p>

<p>My impression on the talks overall was that they were well done and that the speakers were generally engaging.  The topics focused a little much on browser-side MV* frameworks, but I guess that's hot right now.  Every talk I went to was meant for beginners at a very introductory level.  That was disappointing.  Of the topics presented, I found myself surprisingly most interested in Emberjs.  I have been tinkering with it since then and need to build something with it.</p>

<h2>The Food</h2>

<p>There was a plentitude of simple carbohydrates ready to serve to all learners at all times.  That was awesome.  Pastries appeared for breakfast, un-advertised.  They didn't do a boxed lunch this year.  Some didn't cry.  I almost did.  But I was pointed to a great gryo at a nearby Greek eatery instead.  Apparently the host venue, the Salt Lake City Public Library, didn't approve of serving food.  This, I don't understand, given that there was plenty of food floating around.  Apparenly pastries are ok, and sandwiches are not.</p>

<h2>The People</h2>

<p>Always a fun flavor to a conference, the attendees were great to mingle with.  The JavaScript community is a fun group to be with.  In Utah, we're a fairly small, tight group.  It was fun to have Tom Dale show up.  It was even said by some that the Ember folks were "actually nice" as opposed to what was thought to be observed by some on Twitter.  Haha.  I smiled quite a bit when I heard that.</p>

<h2>The Afterparty</h2>

<p>The party was put on by O.C. Tanner and Domo.  O.C. Tanner is my current home base.  We were in charge of prepping the space.  It was like a classic text adventure trying to guide party-comers through the labyrinth of the O.C. Tanner building to the eventual pot of gold that was the party.</p>

<p>The food never stopped coming, even after my stomach had taken on its full capacity.  Marvelous Catering (gotta love that name) provided a delicious "luau pork dinner".  I heard "luau" and assumed pineapple, of which there was none, which disappointed me just a little.  The owner of Fongo Bongo, a local game shop supplied a great collection of board and card games.  We had a couple Xboxen humming whilst TVs blasted fighting games to which I knew no combos.  We had a great time.</p>

<h2>Next Year</h2>

<p>I'm glad that this event has shown some perpetuity.  I hope it continues next year.  I think they have a good formula.  The price, the locale, the speaker lineup, and the associated activities make for a good one-day experience each Spring.  I would focus on improving one bit next year: the website.  It was the least well-done part of the conference.  I find that extremely ironic given the target market for the event.</p>

<p>So next Spring, come to Utah and attend the JsConf.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/test-settimeout-with-jasmine/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-15T07:08:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/test-settimeout-with-jasmine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Code that utilizes <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code> becomes asynchronous.  Jasmine has some nice helpers to make your test synchronous again.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ks3wt01.jpg" alt="Jasmine" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Code Using setTimeout</h2>

<p>Any Javascript code that wants to delay certain actions or give intervals between actions will use <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code> respectively.  There are also libraries that create some niceties for working in these situations, notably <a href="http://underscorejs.org">underscore</a>'s <code>_.throttle</code> and <code>_.debounce</code> functions.  Underneath all of these higher-level functions, they're using the native <code>setTimeout</code> construct, so the same strategies will apply.  In your source, you end up with something like this:</p>

<p><code>coffeescript
$(document).on 'keyup', '.autocomplete-field', _.debounce(autocomplete, 500)
</code></p>

<p>This code binds a keyup event listener on a contrived <code>.autocomplete-field</code>.  Of course, we don't want to do an expensive <code>autocomplete</code> lookup on every keypress.  So, we'll slow it down a bit with <code>_.debounce</code>.</p>

<h2>Testing Asynchronous Code in Jasmine</h2>

<p>Now we go to test it in Jasmine (failing):</p>

<p>```coffeescript
  describe 'Autocomplete Field', -></p>

<pre><code>it 'calls autocomplete when typing', -&gt;
  called = false
  autocomplete = -&gt;
    called = true

  keyup = $.Event('keyup')
  $('.autocomplete-field').trigger keyup
  called.should.be.true
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In this test, or <code>autocomplete</code> spy will never be called, thus <code>called</code> will never be true.  There are a few ways to fix this.</p>

<h2>Mocking the Jasmine Clock</h2>

<p>One way to fix the test is to remove <code>_.debounce</code> from our source code.  That would make the test pass.  The other is to setup our Jasmine to handle the <code>setTimeout</code> used in <code>_.debounce</code>.  Let's do the latter, and raise our fists to the sky in triumph over our testing foe (winning):</p>

<p>```coffeescript
  describe 'Autocomplete Field', -></p>

<pre><code>beforeEach -&gt;
  jasmine.Clock.useMock()

it 'calls autocomplete when typing', -&gt;
  called = false
  autocomplete = -&gt;
    called = true

  keyup = $.Event('keyup')
  $('.autocomplete-field').trigger keyup
  jasmine.Clock.tick 501
  called.should.be.true
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The needed code is simple to add.  Use <code>jasmine.Clock.useMock()</code> to setup the fake ticker.  Then call <code>tick()</code> on it whenever you want your test to simulate time massage.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that this does not slow down your tests.  You could set the clock tick to be 50100000 or some crazy number, and it will still execute as fast as your single JavaScript thread will let you.</p>

<p>Boom.  Another testing hurdle cleared.  Sometimes it's harder to write the test than the code.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/livereload-for-nodejs/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-23T16:44:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/livereload-for-nodejs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LiveReload is a wonderful tool/strategy for being able to develop websites more quickly.  You can make a change and see it immediately shown in the browser without requiring you to manually refresh.  To do this in NodeJs with Express, you'll need just a few packages.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4773D.jpg" alt="grunt" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>LiveReload Express</h2>

<p>If you're doing a website on Nodejs these days, you're probably using Express.  Express uses the Connect library for its middleware scheme.  Just grab one more middleware to handle the LiveReload.  It will add a little snippet of JavaScript to each of the html responses that is requested through this middleware.  First, install:</p>

<p><code>
npm install connect-livereload --save-dev
</code></p>

<p>Next, import:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">configure</span> <span class="s">&#39;development&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;connect-livereload&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="mi">35729</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Note that we only want to import and use the middleware when in development.  This matches the fact that we are only declaring this package as in <code>devDependencies</code>.</p>

<h2>LiveReload Grunt</h2>

<p>Now you need to something to start a livereload server, watch files for changes, and broadcast their availability.  The rest of this will be done via Grunt.</p>

<p>First, install:</p>

<p><code>
npm install grunt-cli -g
npm install grunt grunt-regarde grunt-contrib-livereload --save-dev
</code></p>

<ul>
<li><code>grunt-cli</code> will allow you to run the <code>grunt</code> command in the terminal.  Global puts the bin in your path.</li>
<li><code>grunt-regarde</code> is a file watcher.  It senses changes to the filesystem.</li>
<li><code>grunt-contrib-reload</code> will handle the pushing of new code to the browser.</li>
</ul>


<p>Next setup the <code>Gruntfile.coffee</code>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>

<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nv">module.exports = </span><span class="nf">(grunt) -&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">code</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nv">regarde:</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">files: </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;app/static/css/*.css&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">tasks: </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;livereload&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="nx">code</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nx">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>  <span class="nx">grunt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">loadNpmTasks</span> <span class="s">&#39;grunt-contrib-livereload&#39;</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>  <span class="nx">grunt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">registerTask</span> <span class="s">&#39;be-lively&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="s">&#39;livereload-start&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;regarde&#39;</span> <span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now when you run:</p>

<p><code>
grunt be-lively
</code></p>

<p>A livereload server is going to be setup.  Then we watch for filesystem changes.  The only things we're watching are css files in our app.  You could expand the <code>files</code> array to watch more if you wish.</p>

<p>Yay!</p>

<h2>LiveReload all the Things</h2>

<p>There are many ways to make this happen.  There are numerous Node libraries, Grunt plugins, and browser plugins.  Do what works for you.  Just make it happen fast and tend it well from the beginning to the end of your project.  Almost every solution I've found is somewhat high maintenance.  This one has proven to be the same.  What have you found to be your favorite LiveReload solution, and in what environment?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Xip.io is a DNS wildcard domain that was initially created for use on Ruby projects.  But its application is desirable across platforms.  Recently, I wanted to use Xip.io on a NodeJs project.  It was easy to make happen.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PJTnZmM.jpg" alt="xip.io" /></p>

<h2>Update: Proxying is Built Into Pow</h2>

<p>After having a handful of problems with these home-grown proxies, my search eventually led me to know that Pow 0.4.0+ includes proxying as a built-in feature.  So, you don't need your own <code>config.ru</code> any more.  Once you install pow, choose the port that your app will run on and at what pow address you want to access your app, and run one command in your terminal:</p>

<p><code>
echo 3000 &gt; ~/.pow/myapp
</code></p>

<p>Then you'll access your app, running in the background on port 3000 via the web browser at <code>http://myapp.dev</code>.  Way better.  Skip the rest of this article.</p>

<h2>Install Pow and Powder</h2>

<p>Pow is a development server that uses Xip.io.  Powder is a cli that makes working with Pow even easier.  To start, make sure that <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a> is setup with <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems</a> in your environment.  Then install Pow.  They have a short little install script you can run, as <a href="http://pow.cx/">referenced on the Pow site</a>.</p>

<p>Then install Powder:</p>

<p><code>
gem install powder
</code></p>

<h2>Proxy your NodeJs app</h2>

<p>Pow only knows how to handle Rack apps, so we have to create one to be loaded into Pow.  Since we're writing the guts of our app on another platform -- in this case, Node -- we'll just create a proxy Rack app.</p>

<p>I found a bit of <a href="https://github.com/linjunpop/node-with-pow">proxy app code</a>, which you should save in your project root as <code>config.ru</code>, and which I paste here:</p>

<p>The only change you might have to make is the port number for your app (line 13).  In this case, I'm using port 3000 for my NodeJs app.</p>

<h2>Link Your App</h2>

<p>Now all we have to do is link our app to Pow.  Powder helps us do this easily.  Go to your project root directory and type:</p>

<p><code>
powder link &lt;project_name&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Now run your app with whatever command starts NodeJs.  It's probably something like this:</p>

<p><code>
node app.js
</code></p>

<p>Now you should be able to access your app via your web browser at <code>http://&lt;project_name&gt;.dev</code>.  One of the great things about Xip.io is that it makes running your local app <a href="http://jaketrent.com/post/run-pow-server-on-vm/">extremely easy from a local Virtual machine</a> as well.  To get the address of your app to use in your VM, type this from your native terminal:</p>

<p><code>
powder open --xip
</code></p>

<p>And copy the resulting URL into your VM web browser.</p>

<p>Ah, the fusion of Node and Ruby is pretty sweet.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/yeoman-app-on-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-23T07:12:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/yeoman-app-on-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yeoman is great developer tool that will help you generate a project format that is easy to get up and running quickly.  Out of the box, Yeoman only generates static sites.  But, with a few small tweaks, you can get it running on an app server, Nodejs, and up on Heroku.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1Mc2kXh.jpg" alt="Yeoman" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>New Project With Yeoman</h2>

<p>To install Yeoman, run:</p>

<p><code>
npm install -g yo
</code></p>

<p>Now navigate to your new project directory and generate the scaffolding by running:</p>

<p><code>
yo webapp
</code></p>

<p>There are other generators, specifically for angularjs or a handful of other frameworks.  To see more options, run:</p>

<p><code>
yo --help
</code></p>

<h2>Add Node for Heroku</h2>

<p>Since Yeoman creates a static site, it should be read to serve out of any old web server.  But Heroku specifically wants an app server.  Node is one of the options, and it's a great option for a lightweight app server.</p>

<p>To get the node dependencies you need, create a <code>package.json</code> via:</p>

<p><code>
npm init
</code></p>

<p>Then pull down the dependencies you'll need:</p>

<p><code>
npm install gzippo express coffee-script --save
</code></p>

<p>Now create your app server, <code>web.coffee</code>.  It's about as light as they come:</p>

<p>It's going to be serving the static resources that you build w/ Yeoman/Grunt that end up in the <code>dist</code> directory.  In order for code to get to Heroku, it needs to be commited to your git repo.  Thus, you need to remove the "dist" line from your <code>.gitignore</code> file, and don't forget to add and commit the files to git as you build them.  You may also have to add more tasks to the <code>Gruntfile.js</code> to copy over any other assets to <code>dist</code> that your app needs to run.</p>

<p>Finally create a <code>Procfile</code> file for Heroku in the root of your project that points to the <code>web.coffee</code> server:</p>

<p><code>
web: coffee web.coffee
</code></p>

<p>Now it's time to push to Heroku.  You should have the Heroku Toolbelt installed and create a heroku url by running:</p>

<p><code>
heroku create &lt;my_project&gt;
</code></p>

<p>To test your yeoman app as it will be run in production, first build it:</p>

<p><code>
grunt build
</code></p>

<p>Then run the grunt server:</p>

<p><code>
grunt server:dist
</code></p>

<p>Or if you have foreman and want to run the app using your <code>Procfile</code>, run:</p>

<p><code>
foreman start
</code></p>

<p>It's time.  Commit your code, especially that <code>dist</code> directory, and... deploy!</p>

<p><code>
git push heroku master
</code></p>

<p>There are quite a few steps there.  What did we miss?  Or what needs more explanation?  Perhaps we just need a <code>yo heroku</code> target.</p>
