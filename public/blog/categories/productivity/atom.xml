    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Agile method of software creation contains many principles of development that will help create good software.  Some of my most successful projects have had as a key feature an agile designer.  As Jobs said, design <em>is</em> how it works, and that means that to really deliver well in an agile environment, design <em>and</em> development have to be on the agile train together.</p>

<h2>K-man Keeps it Alive</h2>

<p>I work with a fantastic designer, the one and only <a href="http://www.composition3.com/">Kendall Chadwick</a>.  He has many great qualities of an agile designer:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>He's available</strong> - He lives with the cross-functional team.  He is there to participate in discussions.  It's not hard to get a hold of him, so answers to questions flow more freely.</li>
<li><strong>He listens</strong> - He asks a lot of questions.  He's not stuffy about his design sense.  He realizes that many needs are represented in a project and product.  He attends discussion meetings not necessarily focused on design but on the details of the product or process.</li>
<li><strong>He's fully engaged</strong> - He knows his task doesn't end when he clicks save in Photoshop.  He owns his designs and ideas all the way through the project, helping evolve them as we go. One of the most important things a software team member can do is remain fully engaged right up until the product ships.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Agile Experience Design</h2>

<p>I just finished a book called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Experience-Design-Designers-Continuous/dp/0321804813">Agile Experience Design</a>" by Lindsay Ratcliffe and Marc McNeill.  I've read a fair bit on agile methods and currently live in a quasi-agile (hehe, let's actually call it mini-waterfalls) shop.  This book was intriguing as its authors are speaking to designers as they try to integrate better in an agile environment.</p>

<p>Of note was their Agile Design Manifesto:</p>

<p>Agile experience design is
Inclusive rather than elitist
Emergent with direction rather than up front
Integrated and collborative rather than handed over the fence
Considerate of customer, business, and technology needs rather than biased toward a single factor.</p>

<p>As a passing review:  The book won't provide too much that is new to someone familiar with agile.  It speaks in terms that I suppose are probably more well related to by designers.  It's a somewhat lengthy and dense book.  At times, it was hard to maintain reading momentum.  The book is beautiful -- perhaps it had some real designers laying it out?</p>

<h2>The Power of Design</h2>

<p>It's amazing how much depends on solid design.  The design will define the users' experience with the software.  It will never not matter.  To a great design in a software product is a difficult thing.  Good people in the design discipline who are fully engaged in adapting to the changing landscape of software creation are invaluable.  Agile designers rock.  Find one and figure out how to get him on your project.</p>

<p>What have your best designers done to make great software on your teams?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When a company has a platform or API that it wants outside developers to create cool stuff on, it will sometimes create a developer relations group. This group will help developers get what they need. What about custom dev shops that already have a host of developers? Who's watching these developers' backs?</p>

<h2>A new level of developer relations</h2>

<p>RIM developer relation needs being what they are, they've gone this far to promote their BlackBerry 10 SDK:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WlsahuZ_4oM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>It's awesome. Maybe "desperate"? It shows a definite effort (high notes) to attract and accommodate developers.</p>

<h2>Essential vitamins and minerals</h2>

<p>Once developers are in a company, what are the elements of developer relations that are needful there. What does a company need to retain top coding talent? I offer:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Engaging Responsibilities</strong> - Smart guys are not going to sit around in your company doing the same thing for 10 years. In tech, probably not even for a couple. This might also be stated as "Career Path". I think this requirement is similar to what <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-young-employees-quit-their-jobs-2012-9">Business Insider observed young workers</a> as needing: "Multiple studies find that today’s younger workers have absolutely no intention of sticking around if they don’t feel like they’re learning, growing and being valued in a job."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning Opportunities</strong> - Learning is an inherent part of every developer job description. It must be kosher to spend time to sharpen the saw. This is building capactiy. No one will ever propose solutions that they don't understand. If your company wants to broaden its offering, developers will need to broaden themselves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Budget for Engineering</strong> - Build money into project budgets. Build time into the timelines. Good developers will quickly lose morale if there is never time to do it right. If you don't give time to cleanup technical debt, developers will not feel satisfied in what they create.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Always Have an Advocate</strong> - Every company will get it wrong sometimes. Especially in large, specialized organizations, everyone has their own functional slice that they're focused on, sometimes at the expense of all else. Developers need someone who speaks for them. They need someone who has a voice in the bureaucracy and can represent them well where they don't personally have a voice.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Everyone needs a coder, especially a good one</h2>

<p>If developer relations are not upkept with care, good coders are likely to head for the door. Alternately, if just certain elements are occassionally missing, good developers know how to fill in the gaps and provide for themselves.</p>

<p>Just as an API/platform creator attract talent to build cool stuff for them, organizations with their own internal dev force need to take developer relations seriously. Good organizations and good leaders take good care of all their people.  I work at such an organization with such people.  We need more.</p>

<p>What else might be an essential ingredient in maintaining favorable developer relationships?</p>
