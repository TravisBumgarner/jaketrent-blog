  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have spent mucho time trying to get some named parameters working in the &#8220;order by&#8221; clause of a dynamic sql query that I&#8217;m building.  The query isn&#8217;t even HQL/JPQL.  It&#8217;s native.  And yet, it turns out that you cannot use bind variables, named or ordered, in an order by clause.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently read Release It! by Michael Nygard.  I became interested in this book when the NFJS 2008 panel cited it as their #1 suggested read.  In my view, the essence of Nygard&#8217;s expose boils down to two points:</p>

<ol>
<li>One can build software that passes QA with flying colors and still fails miserably in real environments.</li>
<li>Problem in production are unavoidable. Good software will be able to navigate them as gracefully as possible.</li>
</ol>


<p>That said, the book was mostly conceptual, offering real-world examples of how antipatterns in software development made problems that were encountered even worse.  Then, he counters with patterns in stability, capacity, general design, and operations.  The principles discussed are those that most developers have at least some exposure to, but those that we don&#8217;t necessarily consider every day.  These consist mostly of non-functional requirements that do not often enjoy QA scrutiny.  The set of antipatterns and patterns is one that I think all developers, QA, and project managers would do well to consider within the scope of their current and future projects.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a thoughtful book.  I particularly enjoyed the sections on capactiy and stability that seemed more immediately applicable to my everday life in code.  I found the operations section to be the driest, but giving me opportunity to consider the plight of sys admins.  I would agree with the NFJS panel and highly recommend the read.</p>

<p>I have included a short slide deck on the stability section with some highlights on what one might consider and what is explained in much clearer detail in the book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>EasyMock is a great tool for separating external dependencies from unit tests.  There is a learning curve to learning the mock method of testing, and unfortunately, EasyMock does not give very good prompts when you do something wrong.  The exception messages are actually quite cryptic.  This article is meant to be a crude mapping of exception output and the behavior that might have caused it.  At least, this is a log of many of my experiences with EasyMock and how I usually get into the messes I do.  It is quite possible that the same exception output could be had via different behavior.  It&#8217;s also important to note that I&#8217;m not trying to show how to create meaningful tests here (I don&#8217;t even show full tests half the time), only help figure out how mysterious EasyMock exceptions were thrown.  These experiences were documented on EasyMock 2.2 and 2.4.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For unit testing purposes, I often want to set field values in objects so that I can setup for the test conditions.  One of most annoying things about testing is the urge to change code design for just the sake of testing &#8211; especially if it&#8217;s in a way that is considered less safe, like exposing elements or lessening accessibility.  (This is not to say that trying to test code can reveal certain code smells and prompt refactoring).  I, myself, have a number of setter methods with this comment prepended: &#8220;// for test only comments&#8221;.  Stinkers!  Well, sometimes enough becomes enough.  So, here&#8217;s a way to set any field on an object w/o exposing it.  This is done via reflection.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mark Logic Server seems to be the latest, greatest in content serve-up.  At least it is generating a lot of excitement at the LDS Church, where it&#8217;s being used for new content-centric apps/sites.  Being caught in the wave of awesome, I was interested in getting it running in my favorite dev environment: Ubunutu-flavored Linux.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t bad at all.  In fact, it was accomplished in almost as few steps as installing Apache or Tomcat.  Except, after this installation, full XML xquery&#8217;age is now possible!  Here are the steps, slightly elongated by the fact that all Mark Logic-supported Unix systems are rpm-based.</p>
