    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some might ask why a guy who loves his life of code would choose WordPress as the framework for one of his websites. Well, I chose a WordPress blog. I almost didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s been a long time coming. It&#8217;s early in the game, but I think it was a good choice.</p>

<h2>Why I wouldn&#8217;t choose WordPress blog</h2>

<p>I only had one job about 7 years back that consisted of mostly PHP. The job was great for many reasons. PHP wasn&#8217;t the highlight. We did some cool stuff with it. At the time, it was all right. Since, I have coded full time in Java, Python, XQuery, or JavaScript. I would count each as <strong>more</strong> enjoyable than PHP.</p>

<p>Secondly, I&#8217;m a coder. I love to build stuff. Custom software is way more fun than boxed software. WordPress is something that is literally accessible to anyone that&#8217;s just computer savvy. I&#8217;m not breaking new ground on WordPress.</p>

<h2>An insightful article</h2>

<p>A week or so ago, I ran into an article on a site called &#8220;Virtuous Code&#8221;. That site name was cool enough. The article was typed (&#8220;penned&#8221; is such a cooler word) by Avdi Grimm and is named <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2012/08/09/why-wordpress/">&#8220;Why WordPress&#8221;</a>. I was caught off guard by how well it described my personal predicament.</p>

<h2>Why I chose a WordPress blog</h2>

<p>When I read Avid&#8217;s article, I realized that the reasons I, as a coder, had been avoiding WordPress were the very reasons I should embrace it:</p>

<ol>
<li>As a coder, my tendency to jump into the internals and start toying around is strong. This hinders my writing ability. It competes for my time. Writing is something that I really want to do more of. By choosing a package that&#8217;s tied up with a bow will encourage me to just use it instead of over-customize it. And since the innards of the package is a language that I don&#8217;t want to devote a ton of my time to, I&#8217;m even less inclined to customize it.</li>
<li>PHP and WordPress are, in a way, like JavaScript &#8211; they&#8217;re everwhere, and everyone is using them. This means that probably just about everything that I could imagine wanting (ok, I&#8217;ll probably come up with something innane) on a blog has already been built. I don&#8217;t need to reinvent it.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Driven to the edge</h2>

<p>So, I made the jump. I just downloaded the latest <a href="http:://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a> package. I ran Apache on my local box and pointed my browser to <code>localhost:8888</code>. I was presented with the pleasant admin UI. I chose a new theme. It installed in place. It was a 2-click ordeal. I chose a few plugins to replace default functionality and add a bit more. I was pleasantly surprised by the smoothness of it all.</p>

<p>At the point I was getting the blog looking nice and doing what I wanted, did I care that the thing was written in PHP? No. I saw it just once when setting up my DB connection. I did cringe slightly upon seeing some <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php">super globals</a> again (<code>$_SERVER</code>), but I hastily committed the change and deployed the app.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see if I continue to love it, but so far, so good. My fellow coders, I ask: Is my reasoning sound?</p>
