<!--more-->

## Day 1

- [mjackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson) - [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) is a cdn capable of serving modules natively in the browser, so include a "module" attribute in your package.json
- [sxywu](https://twitter.com/sxywu) - there is no *best* approach to d3 in react so far, which is ok, as long as you just make more viz
- [devonbl](https://twitter.com/devonbl) - hardware is hard, but try the [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org), [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/), [pm532](https://www.adafruit.com/product/364) for NFC, and [react-hardware](https://github.com/iamdustan/react-hardware), and you'll be on the right track
- [chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic) - the simplicity of react is why you love it
- [linclark](https://twitter.com/linclark) - WebAssembly's great, obvious, future application in React would be to write the reconciler in it
- [benmvp](https://twitter.com/benmvp) - react 16 has some great new features
- [bonniemilianb](https://twitter.com/bonniemilianb) - getting into deep learning can be fun, so try [google facial recognition api](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
- [necolas](https://twitter.com/necolas) - [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) has the potential to allow truly cross-platform component authoring through primitive components
- [ipancreas](https://twitter.com/ipancreas) - use tech in good ways, not being constrained by public perception (eg, webcams/[webgazer.js](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/))
- [zackargyle](https://twitter.com/zackargyle) - don't write your own service worker, but use [offline-plugin](https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin), [sw-precache](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache), [workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/), or [service-workers](https://github.com/pinterest/service-workers)

## Day 2

- [iam_preethi](https://twitter.com/iam_preethi) - we were all beginners once, so remember those feelings, have empathy, and help beginners
- [czaplic](https://twitter.com/czaplic) - asking if React or Elm is better is not the best question because they both contain great ideas
- [left_pad](https://twitter.com/left_pad) - get involved in OSS, where we're just people that need others' help
- [sugargreenbean](https://twitter.com/sugargreenbean) - enterprise software means those that are persistent, fast, usable
- [thelarkinn](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn)- understanding webpack and its series of plugins will allow you to be able to contribute
- [cmatheson](https://twitter.com/cmatheson) - batch load queries in graphql
- [daajust](https://twitter.com/daajust) - setState has to be async in react
- [davidkpiano](https://twitter.com/davidkpiano) - Declaring ui as state machines be cleaner
- [carakuei](https://twitter.com/carakuei) - [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) can allow incisive migrations from legacy to new systems.
- [mxstbr](https://twitter.com/mxstbr) - when you make something, ask yourself if it could be open source.

## The Conference

The Conference was a blast, as usual.  Another stellar line up of speakers.  Well-balanced schedule.  Nice venue that worked well.  No snafus.  No awkward q&as.  Nice people.  Warm crowd.  Lots and lots of great content.  Thanks, Jamison and Matt, for the epic conference!
