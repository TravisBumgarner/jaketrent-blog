An interesting and concerning top shown in journalistic excellence from Ted Koppel.  It seems that the issue of a potential cyberattack is only reported in very dramatic and flaboyant terms and then nothing is seemingly done about it.  Mr. Koppel looks at the potentiality (or eventuality in the eyes of some) of a cyberattack that affects the U.S. electrical grid.  The predicted outcomes are just as or more devastating than other types of mass destruction.  There are pockets of prepared parties, but the country is generally unaware and under-prepared.  Koppel tries to raise our awareness and hopefully our preparedness.
