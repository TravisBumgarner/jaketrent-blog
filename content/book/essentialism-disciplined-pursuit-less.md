Many of us seek to do it all or have it all.  It will never be enough, and in this pursuit we can see our own effectiveness and happiness diminishing.  We get spread too thin, like butter over too much toast.  If we can learn to find contentment and focus, we can be present for what matters in our lives.  If we can edit out and say no to those things that are good but not our top priority, our lives will start to look more like what we want.
