---

There are the glittering rich which have great incomes and great expenditures to match.  These are the hyper consumers.  Then there are those with great incomes that imitate them, but simply shoverl all their income into consumption.  They can't keep up with their own spending habits.  These are those that merely *act* rich.  Then there are the majority of really wealthy people in America who have great wealth but do not flaunt it or even indulge in it.  There are instead, on the whole, quite frugal.  The book explores these people at great length.  Unfortunately also in great repetition.  The book is about 7/8 too long.
