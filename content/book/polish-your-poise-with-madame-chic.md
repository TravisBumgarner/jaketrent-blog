This book inspired me to put forth a better me -- use better manners, better posture, nicer clothing.  The world has a lot of sloppiness and apparent lack of care for self and surrounding.  This is a book that is written for women, but there was plenty to learn as general advice on how to bring more poise and respect into the world.  I've a long way to go until I achieve the zen of poise, but I'm trying to improve.
