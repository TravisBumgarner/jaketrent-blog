title: "I'm Happy For You -- Finding Contentment in a Culture of Comparison"
---

We rob ourselves of joy when we compare ourselves needlessly to others.  We will find more contentment as we stop comparing.  And yet we find comparison everywhere.  We want our kid to learn soccer, then make the team, then go varsity, then the club team -- it's never enough, and we've never made it, and it's exhausting.  The same can be seen in the tech industry, as opportunities are many, we flit between great jobs, hoping for something better, bigger, more aggrandizing.  We compare likes on our posts, followers on our feed.  The never-ending stair-stepper of comparison will not leave us satisfied, but wanting.  If we can learn to be genuinely happy for others and grateful for the circumstances we have, greater happiness will be more available to us.  But first we need to stop comparing.
