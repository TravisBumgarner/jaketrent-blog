title: Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble
---

Dan Lyons, laid off from his job as a satirist, joins a hot tech startup in Boston, Hubspot.  He doesn't like.  He finds much of it ridiculous.  Most of his tone is ridiculing.  It's entertainment.  Mixed with that, there is evidence of bad leadership, manipulation, and ill treatment of people.
