Richard Garriott is an interesting man!  He has done many things and been many places.  In his book, he highlights his explorations and creations.  Richard is well-known for being one of the first private citizens to travel in space.  He made the Ultima games and cofounded Origin Systems.  He has been in a submarine to explore the Titanic.  He has been hunting for meteorites in Antarctica.  He has created internationally-known haunted houses.  He has flown in 0 Gs with Steven Hawking.  He has lived aboard the International Space Station.  The book is full of him telling stories of his adventures.  The breadth of adventure is such that there are some super interesting anecdotes and facts to learn in this book.  If it wasn't for a couple foul words, I'd recommend this very interesting book even more.
