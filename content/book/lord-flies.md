It was an interesting read but also disturbing.  It's sobering to realize the tenuous nature of our peace.  We have built a civilization and society where people can live together in peace.  But take away many of its pillars and leave man to himself in desparate situations and we are apparently not as civilized as we might otherwise think.  Obviously no one would ever want to see themselves in such a situation, and our collective gratitude for our current gifts of culture and civilization increases.
