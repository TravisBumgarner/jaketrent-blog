title: "You, Inc.: The Art of Selling Yourself"
---

You, Inc. was an enjoyable read.  It felt like skimming through the microblog of an Internet author who had collected a bunch of good aphorism and anecdotes on how to present oneself, conduct business or find happiness.  My favorite tidbit, which I've found in Derek Siver's decidedly [better summary](https://sivers.org/book/YouInc), is this:

"Do what you love.
The money may follow and please you.
The money may follow but pleases you less than you expected.
The money may follow but pleases you only briefly. (Maslow said humans are only capable of temporary satisfaction. Once something satifies us, we move on to our next unsatisfied desire.)
The money may not follow, which might disappoint you.
But if you're doing what you love, you will have loved what you've been doing.
That will satisfy you so deeply that the result must either be called success or recognized as something even more enriching."

That is a great example of the pithy thoughts that were gathered together in this book.  The title could potentially be misleading.  It was not droll or narcissistic. ([whew!] well at least there's that!)
