There are a lot of stereotypes about the starving artist that Jeff Goins tries to debunk.  He tells of examples from history, such as Leonard DaVinci, who were very successful economically, socially, or otherwise as artists.  He has some good insights into what they did generally that we might apply to our artistic pursuits.
