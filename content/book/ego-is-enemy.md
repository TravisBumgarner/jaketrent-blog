This book contains some sound advice from the ages that should bring us back to earth.  There is so much self aggrandizement in our society today.  We're encouraged into this mode.  Ryan has apparently been there himself, measuring great success in the things valued by society.  He found his experiences less than satisfying.  We should be more grounded in who we really are, what we can accomplish, and what our expectations should be.  A good read with good reminders.
