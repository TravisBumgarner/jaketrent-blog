Join Captain Phillips off the Somali coast on your very own container ship.  It's so much yours, in fact, that the very React and Redux implementations that drive it are custom-coded in your own hand.  This is a fun little game.  More importantly, it was an opportunity to illuminate some of the core concepts of React+Redux by reimplementing parts of them from scratch.  A future course will expand on this subject and can be found at [CodeUrOwn.com](https://codeurown.com).
